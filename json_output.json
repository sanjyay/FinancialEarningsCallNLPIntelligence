Thank\nyou and over to you, sir.\nAshish Damani: Good evening, everyone. Thank you for taking time out and join us on this call.\nLet me just first greet you. Wish you a very Happy Diwali, Dussehra, Season's Greetings. We\nwish you a good New Year as well.\nLet me give you some highlights on the results:\nWe have already put up the Presentation, and I believe most of you would have got a chance to\ngo through the deck. And if you have done so, I am sure you would have noticed improvements\nin all the lead parameters.\nLet me start by highlighting few trends that we have been witnessing, and we are very excited\nabout:\nConcentrated industry-wide efforts have been made and have started yielding results. One of the\nlead indicators is the over-levered borrowers across the industry has been coming down.\nOur X-bucket collection efficiency, if you would have noticed, has been behaving very strongly\nand has been improving. We have reported 98.7% as of September as against 97.9% which we\nhad in June last quarter. X-bucket collection efficiency for October as well has been strong and\nis at around 98.5%. Obviously, it is a slight dip compared to the September month but that is\nowing to, less number of working days, festive season, rains and some floods which we have\nseen in some parts of the country. What is more heartening is that the improvement has been\nseen across the major geographies including Karnataka which was struggling in the past, now is\nin line with the national average.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nOver 60% of our branches have moved into, a much better zone with more than 99% X-bucket\ncollection efficiency. Our disbursement has also gained momentum. If you look at the numbers\nmonth-on-month, they have been shaping up fine and this has come with improvement in the\nportfolio quality as well. Disbursement for Q2 was Rs. 934 crores as against Rs. 280 crores in\nQ1. In October 2025, disbursement has been a touch lower than September, again the reason\nbeing same, less number of working days and festivities in the month kind of had lower\ndisbursement compared to September, but yes, we are very confident that we will pick up pace\nin the coming months.\nWe have seen consistent improvement in productivity as well. we have given this data per loan\nofficer, the amount disbursed over last few months has been improving and the information has\nbeen shared on slide 6. There have been multiple levers which have aided the improvement in\nthe productivity, starting with some technology initiatives, like we have moved the credit bureau\ncheck upfront for new customer enrollment and higher share of disbursements from the weekly\nbranches, which obviously have been performing better than the monthly branches in terms of\ncollection efficiencies.\nOur existing customer franchise offers us almost close to about Rs. 6,000 crores of disbursement\nopportunity. This has been detailed again in the presentation where you can see that 10 lakh\ncustomers are eligible under the stricter internal guidelines on the approval process that we have\nput and 76% of these customers have only two relationships at best and almost all of them have\nless than 1 lakh loan amount as outstanding. So, there is a big headroom available for us to\ndisburse in this customer base.\nLoans disbursed in FY '26 has been at 28% of our balance sheet for September and I think by\nend of October, this should be almost 37% of the balance sheet. This portfolio has been\nperforming very strongly for us., the delinquent book in this portfolio is just 0.1%. 72% of these\ncustomers have again less than two lender relationships at the time of disbursement. Our internal\nrule engine filters out existing customers who have over 30 DPD and new customers who have\neven 1 DPD before we lend to such customers and these are rejected. Only 1.8% of our customers\nat the time of lending were in 1-30 DPD and rest all customers were in current bucket as we\nhave shortlisted those customers for lending.\nWe continue to drive a strong momentum on the recoveries with multiple focused initiatives. So\nfar, in 2025, we have issued 90,000 demand notices and over 3.3 lakh legal notices. We have\nalso initiated Lok Adalat proceedings against 8,600 plus customers in 4 states. These measures\nhave started yielding results, showing us a lot of promise. We have been able to recover Rs. 7.7\ncrore so far through these initiatives and please bear in mind that these initiatives were initiated\nsometime around August which means this will show a better trajectory, better numbers as we\ngo forward into the quarter. Various digital channels were also introduced to engage and improve\non the digital collections. QR code, SMS, BBPS payments have been adopted so that the\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\ncustomers can make digital payments without any further visits from our field force. A lot of\nefforts are being placed in optimizing operations and cost structure.\nDuring H1 FY '26, we have seen rationalization in the size of operations. 101 branches have\nbeen merged or closed. We expect further improvements in our operating cost structure in the\ncoming quarters. While all the so far mentioned positive trends continue to play out, we maintain\na prudent financial stance. 21% of our assets are in form of cash and bank balances giving us\nflexibility to deploy funds at short notice. The successful closure of rights issue has further\nimproved the company’s capital position with CRAR at 47% at the end of September. Our net\nworth of Rs. 2,227 crores and gearing of 1.5x provides sufficient headroom for future growth of\nthe organization. We have also been able to raise debt funding of Rs. 598 crores over the last 2\nmonths. This stems the confidence that as we go along, we will be able to finance all our future\nlending plans.\nLet me move to the results and give you the business updates:\nLet me start with business drivers:\nWe are continuously evaluating our operational environment and taking measured steps to build\na quality portfolio. As explained earlier, the new book's performance has given us confidence\nand hence we have stepped up the disbursements. During Q2 FY '26, Rs. 934 crores was\ndisbursed as against Rs. 280 crores in the Q1. October has been slightly lower, but we are\nconfident that we will be doing higher numbers as we go into November and December. AUM\nat the end of Q2 was at Rs. 4,088 crores. AUM is an outcome of disbursement as you all\nunderstand and as we step up disbursement, we should be able to record AUM growth from here\non.\nPortfolio Quality:\nLike I have explained earlier, the top 5 states with AUM have shown improving trend in X-\nbucket collection efficiency over the months between July and September. We continue to\nmaintain provisioning for the book at 80%. GNPA at the end of the quarter was 5.62%. However,\nthe standalone number stood at 4.97%. Likewise, our NNPA for standalone was 0.97% and\nNNPA for the quarter was 1.17% at the enterprise level.\nBorrowings & Liquidity:\nWe started the quarter with a comfortable liquidity position of Rs. 1,731 crores. Apart from the\nregular collections, external borrowing of Rs. 160 crores and Rs. 200 crores raised during the\nquarter through the partly paid rights issue supported the disbursement. We had about Rs. 1,179\ncrores of liquidity at the end of Q2 representing 21% of the total assets. As of October, we still\nhave Rs. 1,270 crores in our cash and bank balance.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nLet me give some highlights on the financial performance:\nThe net interest income for the quarter was Rs. 91 crores over Rs. 341 crores reported for Q2 of\nlast year. Lower NII was primarily due to decline in AUM and the interest reversals due to the\nflows into GNPA bucket. PPOP for the quarter was negative at Rs. 40 crores. With\ndisbursements improving and continued rationalization of our operations and costs, we expect\nto turn PPOP positive in the coming quarters.\nYield on the portfolio improved to 19.6% as against 19.4% reported in Q1 FY '26. Improvement\nin yield is reflected positively on our NIM for the quarter, which was at 8.4% as against 8.2%\nreported in Q1. We expect the yield and NIM to start improving from here as the proportion of\nnew portfolio continues to grow in the AUM. The company reported a net loss of Rs. 249 crores\nfor the quarter on account of provisions and higher OPEX relative to the size of operations at\nthis point in time. Additional credit cost of Rs. 86 crores was recognized in second quarter due\nto technical write-off that we have done. If we would have excluded, the impairment cost would\nhave been down to Rs. 172 crores.\nAs indicated in our last Earnings Call, we see FY '26 as a year of rebuilding. The loan book built\nin FY '26 under new credit rules gives us sufficient confidence for the way forward. We expect\nto maintain a steady pace of disbursement throughout the year while constantly keeping an eye\non the behavior of the portfolio. The recent macros and bountiful monsoon also gives us\nsufficient indication of the quality and trend of credit demand in rural India.\nWith this, I would like to thank you again for taking time out to join this call. We have the entire\nmanagement team of Spandana thanking you for your consistent feedback. And now, I request\nthe operator to open the floor for any questions that we may have.\nModerator: Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with the\nquestion-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of S K Debnath from SK.\nPlease go ahead.\nS K Debnath: Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity. I would like to understand that you have\ntaken a lot of NCDs. How are you making the payments of that when you were suffering from\nloss and what are your plans to improve the performance in the next 1 year period?\nAshish Damani: Thank you, Mr. Debnath for the question. So, the focus is on pushing the disbursements, regrow\nthe balance sheet for which we have all the required building blocks. We have worked on the\ncapital side, we have worked on people side, we have worked on also origination improvements\nwhich are required and this should definitely start improving the upcoming quarters in terms of\nperformance. On the NCD side, we are very comfortable. All our liabilities are serviced very\ncomfortably. The company maintains very healthy liquidity. We always carry roughly about 2.5-\n3x of whatever the internal thresholds on the liquidity that has been laid out.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nS K Debnath: Thank you.\nModerator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Aviral Jain from Siguler Guff. Please\ngo ahead.\nAviral Jain: Hi, Ashish, good evening. I have two questions. One is, what is your expectations on\ndisbursement pickup? What is the quantum that we can expect going forward for the balance 2\nmonths of Q3 and Q4? And given the behavior of the book, given X-bucket collection efficiency\nat 98.5%, what is the expectation of the credit cost for the rest of the year, Q3 and Q4\nspecifically?\nAshish Damani: Hi, good evening, Aviral and thanks for the questions. The way it seems like is the disbursement\nis picking up. The industry is facing a challenge on the new customer acquisition; the rejection\nrates have been higher. However, I think with our focus on fixing all, relatively speaking, the\nchallenges that we have been facing on the IT or on the operations side, we are very confident\nthat we should start delivering over Rs. 500 crores in the current quarter and the next quarter,\nour run rate should be something around Rs. 700 plus crores on a monthly basis for the next\nquarter. In terms of credit cost, things have started improving. Like you would have noticed,\nroughly about 2.5%-3% was the flow rate from the current bucket earlier. It is down to 1.5%.\nAnd again, we are confident that as the percentage of new book improves in the balance sheet,\nthis should start sustaining over 99%, which would mean that your flows into the subsequent\nbucket should slow down significantly. And that should have a very positive bearing on the\noverall credit cost that we have. I think currently we have about Rs. 150 crores, which is there\nin the 30-90 bucket. So, I am not expecting flows to be anything more than that during the quarter\ninto the bucket compared to the Rs. 360 crores of flows that we have seen in the last quarter.\nAviral Jain: This is forward flow to 90+ you are saying, right Ashish?\nAshish Damani: That is right.\nModerator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mayank Mistry from JM Financial.\nPlease go ahead.\nMayank Mistry: Hi, sir. Thanks for the opportunity. Sir, question is mainly on the collection efficiency in Bihar\nstate. So, as I was seeing the 20 bps, there is some improvement in the collection efficiency. I\nwas seeing that in Bihar, there is a 10-bps decline in the collection efficiency. And I would like\nto know how is this panning out even in October because given that the elections are nearing,\nhow would we see this going forward? Mainly your experience from the other states if that could\nhelp? And secondly, on the plus three lender base, considering that the write-offs have been\nreally elevated over the last few quarters. I would like to know from this, is it mainly coming in\nfrom this 17% book? And the 23% that has been going on from February onwards. So, should\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nwe see the write-off continuing in maybe next quarter or how should we look at it? These are\nmy questions?\nAshish Damani: So, on the first question, Bihar has been performing strongly for us. It has been at 98.8% like we\npresented. And I think in October also, we have a similar number for Bihar. So, while I\nunderstand there has been upcoming elections, our approach has been measured not just in Bihar,\nbut across the country in terms of disbursements, which is what we are controlling right now.\nAnd the outcome so far has been positive, Mayank. In terms of three lenders and the performance\nthere, yes, the customers who have more number of loans have shown higher delinquencies\nacross the buckets. However, as we start taking measures on increasing the new customers from\nthe buckets where either they have only 1 loan or 2 loans at best, this number should keep going\ndown for Spandana like it has gone down in this quarter. And I think the positive rub-off will be\nseen across the buckets in terms of the collection efficiency.\nMayank Mistry: Sir, can you give me a number of the 17%? How much would be in Stage-II or Stage-III? Any\ncolor on this book?\nAshish Damani: I don't have that number handy right now, but Mayank, we can connect and we will definitely\nshare these numbers with you.\nMayank Mistry: Sure, sir. And how do you see the growth in second half? You said that the disbursements would\ngrow, we understand. But given that, now, should we see the positive growth from Q3 onwards\non a sequential basis?\nAshish Damani: So, there should be improvement in the AUM for sure. However, for the full year, compared to\nlast year, it should be more flattish is what I feel.\nMayank Mistry: Thanks. Thanks a lot. All the best.\nModerator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Meghna Luthra from Incred Equities.\nPlease go ahead, ma'am.\nMeghna Luthra: hi. Thank you, sir, for the opportunity. I had a couple of questions. Firstly, sir, can you explain\na little on the Rs. 86 crores technical provisions? That is not a part of the write-offs, right?\nAshish Damani: Yes, that is right. It is just a nuance that we wanted to highlight that since we have done the\nwrite-offs, we had to take this additional 20%. If we would have left it in the GNPA, probably\nthat cost would have not been incurred right now. We have been practicing a higher write-offs\npresently, and which led to this incremental cost of Rs. 86 crores.\nMeghna Luthra: Because I wasn't sure how do I differentiate this from the 418?\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nAshish Damani: No, it is a subset.\nMeghna Luthra: It is a subset. Understood. So, it is probably not due, overdue to be written off and then you did\nprudential write-offs?\nAshish Damani: No, it is a technical. So, when we do this, we are expecting the field to continue to make all the\nefforts in a regular course of business.\nMeghna Luthra: Thank you. And a couple of more questions. On the slide where this is the breakup of a customer,\nslide 7, there is a breakup of eligible customers at 10 lakh, right, which is 43% and 7% is\nserviced. So, is it fair to understand that this 43% is not serviced and these are ex-customers?\nAshish Damani: A part of them will be ex-customers, roughly about 2 lakhs, but others are active loans with me\nand when we do the scrub, they are all eligible as per my internal filters.\nMeghna Luthra: So, sir, what proportion of this entire, only 2 lakhs will be, you mean to say will be ex-customers\nwhich are not on the books, right?\nAshish Damani: That is right.\nMeghna Luthra: Because this service in H1, you mean to say there were fresh disbursals to 7% in H1?\nAshish Damani: Yes. So, last quarter, we have shown 50% customer base, which was all eligible. I think of that\n7% were given new loans during H1 and the rest, we still have about 43%where we can lend as\nper our internal rules.\nMeghna Luthra: Understood. So, it would be fair to also understand that the borrower count can further go down\nby, do you see like a number in the next, till second half?\nAshish Damani: I think it should go up as we have started pushing our customer acquisition. The member\nacquisition should push a higher customer base and over time, you should start seeing this\nnumber constantly improving.\nMeghna Luthra: So, that can start happening from Q3 itself?\nAshish Damani: So, I think if you look at that slide 6, we would have given the new customer enrollment. We\nhave 22% of the loans were given to the new customers. I think in Q1, it was 15% and this\nquarter, it was 22%. This number will be pushed further is what I was trying to explain.\nMeghna Luthra: Understood. And sir, lastly, I know it is a farsighted, but can you indicate a quarter where you\ncan see operating profit?\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nAshish Damani: Yes. So, we should start seeing in coming quarters. Like we have explained, as the pressure on\nthe GNPA eases up, which is what we are likely to see next quarter, we should start seeing first\nPPOP and then also operating profits.\nMeghna Luthra: Got it. And lastly sir, which state right now, amongst all states, is still yet to catch up with the\ncollection efficiency being, say in the 98%-99% or above percentage, , which state is lagging?\nAshish Damani: So, yes, there is not much of a lag now. Most of the states have come up to speed in terms of the\nnational average, very close to the national average. But if you were to ask me, Andhra Pradesh,\nfor example, has seen some floods and some other challenges. So, more improvement is what\nwe are expecting there.\nMeghna Luthra: And on the covenant front, I guess there would not be any further breaches or anything left, right,\non any of the borrowings?\nAshish Damani: I think we are very comfortable, as things start improving, these challenges for the organization\nshould start subsiding.\nMeghna Luthra: Got it. Thank you so much, sir.\nModerator: Thank you, ma'am. Our next question comes from the line of Rahul Mishra from RTL\nInvestment. Please go ahead, sir.\nRahul Mishra: Hi, Ashish. Thanks for taking my questions. First, any deliberation and thoughts on going down\nthe CGFMU route?\nAshish Damani: Hi, Rahul. Thanks for the question. Yes, we have been deliberating this and internally have\nstarted looking at it. As we understand, the CGFMU is favorable when you have to assume that\nyour overall, loss rate on a pool of loans is beyond 5%. That is when it is effective. However,\nwe are deliberating and positively conclude on this one way or the other in the coming quarter.\nRahul Mishra: Because I guess more than the cost and we understand that probably now may not be the right\ntime because we are just starting to recover, but just from a longer term, more predictable credit\ncosts, that is something which at least most of the players seem to be going down, whether they\nare small finance banks or specialist MFIs. So, just wanted to check that? Secondly, I know you\nhave been asked about this quarter and next quarter. But let us say, FY '26 has been what FY '26\nhas been. Looking out at FY '27, what do you think is, both AUM growth and credit costs that\nwould make you feel satisfied?\nAshish Damani: Yes. So, I can give you only a guesstimate at this point in time, Rahul. But I think what we can\nachieve is, 20% kind of a growth rate. And the credit cost in my mind should not be over 3%. It\nshould be more like a 2.5%-3% kind of a credit cost. Things have started looking up on the X\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nbucket, whether I call it X bucket or when I look at the new portfolio under the new guardrails\nor the new credit filters that we have put has been behaving very strongly at 99.9, even for\nOctober for that matter. Gives us a lot of confidence that the path to recovery in the microfinance\nasset class has kicked off and from here on, it should only improve is how I kind of look ahead.\nRahul Mishra: Understood. And finally, any new senior hires and any update on the MD CEO?\nAshish Damani: So, senior hires, yes, we have hired earlier Head of FRM who has moved into the CRO role. So,\nthat is one hire that we have done. MD CEO, I think it is a UPSI, but we should be positively be\nmaking a formal announcement to the exchanges within next 30 days.\nRahul Mishra: That is very helpful. Thank you so much for answering my questions.\nModerator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Ashlesh Sonje from Kotak Securities.\nPlease go ahead.\nAshlesh Sonje: Hi, Ashish. Good evening. Sir, a few questions. Firstly, in your book, because of these MFIN\nguardrails, how are you looking at the trends on borrower rejection rates now? Is that trend\ngradually declining month after month?\nAshish Damani: Hi, Ashlesh. Good evening. So, the trend continues to be high. If I have to split it out between\nexisting and new member acquisition that we do, the new member acquisition is hovering around\n80% in terms of rejection. And the existing also we are seeing close to about 65% or thereabouts\nin terms of rejection. So, yes, it is high. Having said that, for us, a part of this is also because of\nlot of internal filters that we have put, like as explaining in the new customer acquisition, we are\nvery stringent. We are looking at zero delinquency. One day delinquency is also knocked off.\nWe are very stringent even for the existing customers and we are pegging at 30 days, although\nthe SRO allows you to go up to 60 days in terms of delinquency. So, these matrices also have a\nrole to play. But yes, I think we are comfortable given the portfolio quality being top class right\nnow.\nAshlesh Sonje: And you would have any sense on when these rejection rates could normalize or is it too difficult\nto predict right now?\nAshish Damani: Yes, it is difficult. But I think the way we are looking at it is we just need to step up the new\ncustomer acquisition on a continuous basis going to geographies where there are still white\npatches or green patches and make effort to add. There is a clear headroom there in terms of\nimproving productivity at a LO level and that is our focus area for us.\nAshlesh Sonje: Understood. And secondly, you mentioned that the October collection level is a bit relatively\nmuted as compared to September because of festive and some floods. Can you just list out which\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nare the states where there has been a flood impact and if you have seen anything specific in the\nstate of MP?\nAshish Damani: So, floods, like I told you, Andhra Pradesh has seen pockets where there was flooding. We have\nseen in pockets in Bihar, parts of Odisha and West Bengal are the states. Sorry, your second part\nof the question was MP?\nAshlesh Sonje: Yes, sir.\nAshish Damani: Nothing specific, we have seen. In fact, I am not sure if I have covered that, but MP in terms of\ncollection efficiency has been strong. We continue to see 98.9% kind of X-bucket collection\nefficiency there and disbursement also has been reasonable. In fact, in our case, MP, I think as\na percentage has stepped up from 12% odd to 14% now of the total balance sheet.\nAshlesh Sonje: Understood, sir. And lastly, now that the guardrails have had their desired effect of curtailing\nleverage in the industry, is there any discussion at the industry level or at MFIN level to loosen\nthe guardrails from here because the industry seems to be in a better position today.\nAshish Damani: Again, too early. I think the industry is still evaluating the impact. Given the positive impact on\nthe portfolio quality, maybe, as an industry, we would probably wait a little more for us to\nanalyze what is the negative impact on, let us say, the growth or other areas and then recalibrate.\nHaving said that, are there discussions? Yes, there have been deliberations, nothing concrete to\nmy knowledge has been actioned or has been initiated.\nAshlesh Sonje: Understood, sir. Thank you very much for the responses.\nModerator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Vatsal Parag Shah from Knightstone\nCapital Management. Please go ahead, sir.\nVatsal Parag Shah: Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. So, can you just quantify the slippages for\nthis quarter and last quarter?\nAshish Damani: Yes, sure, Vatsal. We will give you the number. Just give us a moment. So, it was Rs. 552 crores\nfor the Q1 and Rs. 396 crores for Q2.\nVatsal Parag Shah: Got it. And secondly, can you mention what is going on in the Criss Financial AUM, like where\nhas that reached? I think in last year Q4, it was around Rs. 230 crores and hence, we have not\nreceived any update on that?\nAshish Damani: Yes, sure. So, I have my colleague who manages the Criss Financial business, Sushanta Tripathy.\nI will just ask him to update you on what is going on.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nSushanta Tripathy: Yes. Hi, this is Sushanta. I take care of the Criss Financial. So, Criss Financial, we have\nunsecured individual loan and we have the LAP book, Micro LAP. So, put together, we have a\nportfolio of Rs. 671 crores business in total. So, our unsecured individual loan is the rural\nsegment AP, Telangana that we are operating. And the LAP, we have another 6 states we are\noperating, Rajasthan, MP, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and AP, Telangana. So, unsecured individual\nloan, that there is the AP, Telangana, as we mentioned, there is a flood, attrition, other stress are\nthere. So, the portfolio quality is not behaving in line with the other segment like Micro LAP.\nMicro LAP, whatever we have launched, Rs. 290 crore book that is going perfectly fine. We\nhave very less slippages there, less than 1% NPA kind of thing. And that we plan to grow a lot.\nThe journey in the Criss Financial is currently we are the 39% of the portfolio in secured, which\nwas a year back 13% portfolio in secured in this financial that has become 39%-40%. We plan\nto take it to upwards of 50%-55% by year end. So, going forward, the major focus in Criss\nFinancial will be the secured part lending to the Micro LAP segment and reduce the\nconcentration in the unsecured element. So, that is the journey that we envisage. We have good\nbranch network in the Micro LAP, 100 branches are there. Those have started yielding results in\nterms of the productivity and we will grow that book very strong in the coming quarters.\nVatsal Parag Shah: Got it. That was clear. Just one thing, the overall book was around Rs. 670 crores and out of that\nMicro LAP was around Rs. 300 crores, right?\nSushanta Tripathy: Yes. Correct.\nVatsal Parag Shah: So, the overall book will grow or you are going to degrow the unsecured part?\nSushanta Tripathy: No. So, the unsecured part, we will grow. I am saying the proportion of the LAP book will grow,\nbut among that the unsecured part will remain stable or little marginal growth will be there. The\njourney from year to year down the line, we tend to have 70-30 kind of proportion in the book.\nAshish Damani: So, in the immediate run, Vatsal, the way we look at it is, probably individual book will also\ngrow and LAP will also grow. Proportionately, LAP will grow more and over time, like Sushanta\nis saying, the strategy is to keep pushing the secured business and change the balance sheet to a\n70-30 kind of a ratio.\nVatsal Parag Shah: Got it. And have you taken any price hikes in the group loan business?\nAshish Damani: Yes. So, across the group, we have seen increase in interest rates. For Criss, we are at 26% in\nterms of the interest rate and 1.5% as processing fee.\nVatsal Parag Shah: And any price hikes in the microfinance business, the JLG model?\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nAshish Damani: Yes, we have highlighted on page 4, if you see now our pricing will be from 23%-26%,\ndepending upon, which the aging or the vintage of the client with Spandana. And 1.5% is the\nprocessing fee, which used to be at 1%.\nVatsal Parag Shah: Got it. That is very clear.\nModerator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, due to the time constraint, that was the last question for\ntoday. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Ashish Damani for the closing comments.\nAshish Damani: Thank you once again, everyone for joining the call. Like always, we are open to feedback or\nany further clarification questions, which we could not take today. The team and all of us here\nare available for any further clarification. Thank you all and good day to all of you. Thank you\nvery much.\nModerator: Thank you, sir. On behalf of Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited, that concludes this\nconference.

            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nModerator: Ladies and gentlemen, good day and welcome to Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited Q2 and\nH1 FY '26 Earnings Conference Call.\nThis conference call may contain forward-looking statements about the company which are\nbased on beliefs, opinions, and expectations of the company.

Should you need assistance\nduring the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing ‘*’, then ‘0’ on your touchtone\nphone.\nI now hand the conference over to Mr. Ashish Damani - Interim CEO, President and CFO. Thank\nyou and over to you, sir.\nAshish Damani: Good evening, everyone. Thank you for taking time out and join us on this call.\nLet me just first greet you. Wish you a very Happy Diwali, Dussehra, Season's Greetings. We\nwish you a good New Year as well.\nLet me give you some highlights on the results:\nWe have already put up the Presentation, and I believe most of you would have got a chance to\ngo through the deck. And if you have done so, I am sure you would have noticed improvements\nin all the lead parameters.\nLet me start by highlighting few trends that we have been witnessing, and we are very excited\nabout:\nConcentrated industry-wide efforts have been made and have started yielding results. One of the\nlead indicators is the over-levered borrowers across the industry has been coming down.\nOur X-bucket collection efficiency, if you would have noticed, has been behaving very strongly\nand has been improving. We have reported 98.7% as of September as against 97.9% which we\nhad in June last quarter. X-bucket collection efficiency for October as well has been strong and\nis at around 98.5%. Obviously, it is a slight dip compared to the September month but that is\nowing to, less number of working days, festive season, rains and some floods which we have\nseen in some parts of the country. What is more heartening is that the improvement has been\nseen across the major geographies including Karnataka which was struggling in the past, now is\nin line with the national average.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nOver 60% of our branches have moved into, a much better zone with more than 99% X-bucket\ncollection efficiency. Our disbursement has also gained momentum. If you look at the numbers\nmonth-on-month, they have been shaping up fine and this has come with improvement in the\nportfolio quality as well. Disbursement for Q2 was Rs. 934 crores as against Rs. 280 crores in\nQ1. In October 2025, disbursement has been a touch lower than September, again the reason\nbeing same, less number of working days and festivities in the month kind of had lower\ndisbursement compared to September, but yes, we are very confident that we will pick up pace\nin the coming months.\nWe have seen consistent improvement in productivity as well. we have given this data per loan\nofficer, the amount disbursed over last few months has been improving and the information has\nbeen shared on slide 6. There have been multiple levers which have aided the improvement in\nthe productivity, starting with some technology initiatives, like we have moved the credit bureau\ncheck upfront for new customer enrollment and higher share of disbursements from the weekly\nbranches, which obviously have been performing better than the monthly branches in terms of\ncollection efficiencies.\nOur existing customer franchise offers us almost close to about Rs. 6,000 crores of disbursement\nopportunity. This has been detailed again in the presentation where you can see that 10 lakh\ncustomers are eligible under the stricter internal guidelines on the approval process that we have\nput and 76% of these customers have only two relationships at best and almost all of them have\nless than 1 lakh loan amount as outstanding. So, there is a big headroom available for us to\ndisburse in this customer base.\nLoans disbursed in FY '26 has been at 28% of our balance sheet for September and I think by\nend of October, this should be almost 37% of the balance sheet. This portfolio has been\nperforming very strongly for us., the delinquent book in this portfolio is just 0.1%. 72% of these\ncustomers have again less than two lender relationships at the time of disbursement. Our internal\nrule engine filters out existing customers who have over 30 DPD and new customers who have\neven 1 DPD before we lend to such customers and these are rejected. Only 1.8% of our customers\nat the time of lending were in 1-30 DPD and rest all customers were in current bucket as we\nhave shortlisted those customers for lending.\nWe continue to drive a strong momentum on the recoveries with multiple focused initiatives. So\nfar, in 2025, we have issued 90,000 demand notices and over 3.3 lakh legal notices. We have\nalso initiated Lok Adalat proceedings against 8,600 plus customers in 4 states. These measures\nhave started yielding results, showing us a lot of promise. We have been able to recover Rs. 7.7\ncrore so far through these initiatives and please bear in mind that these initiatives were initiated\nsometime around August which means this will show a better trajectory, better numbers as we\ngo forward into the quarter. Various digital channels were also introduced to engage and improve\non the digital collections. QR code, SMS, BBPS payments have been adopted so that the\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\ncustomers can make digital payments without any further visits from our field force. A lot of\nefforts are being placed in optimizing operations and cost structure.\nDuring H1 FY '26, we have seen rationalization in the size of operations. 101 branches have\nbeen merged or closed. We expect further improvements in our operating cost structure in the\ncoming quarters. While all the so far mentioned positive trends continue to play out, we maintain\na prudent financial stance. 21% of our assets are in form of cash and bank balances giving us\nflexibility to deploy funds at short notice. The successful closure of rights issue has further\nimproved the company’s capital position with CRAR at 47% at the end of September. Our net\nworth of Rs. 2,227 crores and gearing of 1.5x provides sufficient headroom for future growth of\nthe organization. We have also been able to raise debt funding of Rs. 598 crores over the last 2\nmonths. This stems the confidence that as we go along, we will be able to finance all our future\nlending plans.\nLet me move to the results and give you the business updates:\nLet me start with business drivers:\nWe are continuously evaluating our operational environment and taking measured steps to build\na quality portfolio. As explained earlier, the new book's performance has given us confidence\nand hence we have stepped up the disbursements. During Q2 FY '26, Rs. 934 crores was\ndisbursed as against Rs. 280 crores in the Q1. October has been slightly lower, but we are\nconfident that we will be doing higher numbers as we go into November and December. AUM\nat the end of Q2 was at Rs. 4,088 crores. AUM is an outcome of disbursement as you all\nunderstand and as we step up disbursement, we should be able to record AUM growth from here\non.\nPortfolio Quality:\nLike I have explained earlier, the top 5 states with AUM have shown improving trend in X-\nbucket collection efficiency over the months between July and September. We continue to\nmaintain provisioning for the book at 80%. GNPA at the end of the quarter was 5.62%. However,\nthe standalone number stood at 4.97%. Likewise, our NNPA for standalone was 0.97% and\nNNPA for the quarter was 1.17% at the enterprise level.\nBorrowings & Liquidity:\nWe started the quarter with a comfortable liquidity position of Rs. 1,731 crores. Apart from the\nregular collections, external borrowing of Rs. 160 crores and Rs. 200 crores raised during the\nquarter through the partly paid rights issue supported the disbursement. We had about Rs. 1,179\ncrores of liquidity at the end of Q2 representing 21% of the total assets. As of October, we still\nhave Rs. 1,270 crores in our cash and bank balance.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nLet me give some highlights on the financial performance:\nThe net interest income for the quarter was Rs. 91 crores over Rs. 341 crores reported for Q2 of\nlast year. Lower NII was primarily due to decline in AUM and the interest reversals due to the\nflows into GNPA bucket. PPOP for the quarter was negative at Rs. 40 crores. With\ndisbursements improving and continued rationalization of our operations and costs, we expect\nto turn PPOP positive in the coming quarters.\nYield on the portfolio improved to 19.6% as against 19.4% reported in Q1 FY '26. Improvement\nin yield is reflected positively on our NIM for the quarter, which was at 8.4% as against 8.2%\nreported in Q1. We expect the yield and NIM to start improving from here as the proportion of\nnew portfolio continues to grow in the AUM. The company reported a net loss of Rs. 249 crores\nfor the quarter on account of provisions and higher OPEX relative to the size of operations at\nthis point in time. Additional credit cost of Rs. 86 crores was recognized in second quarter due\nto technical write-off that we have done. If we would have excluded, the impairment cost would\nhave been down to Rs. 172 crores.\nAs indicated in our last Earnings Call, we see FY '26 as a year of rebuilding. The loan book built\nin FY '26 under new credit rules gives us sufficient confidence for the way forward. We expect\nto maintain a steady pace of disbursement throughout the year while constantly keeping an eye\non the behavior of the portfolio. The recent macros and bountiful monsoon also gives us\nsufficient indication of the quality and trend of credit demand in rural India.\nWith this, I would like to thank you again for taking time out to join this call. We have the entire\nmanagement team of Spandana thanking you for your consistent feedback. And now, I request\nthe operator to open the floor for any questions that we may have.\nModerator: Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with the\nquestion-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of S K Debnath from SK.\nPlease go ahead.\nS K Debnath: Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity. I would like to understand that you have\ntaken a lot of NCDs. How are you making the payments of that when you were suffering from\nloss and what are your plans to improve the performance in the next 1 year period?\nAshish Damani: Thank you, Mr. Debnath for the question. So, the focus is on pushing the disbursements, regrow\nthe balance sheet for which we have all the required building blocks. We have worked on the\ncapital side, we have worked on people side, we have worked on also origination improvements\nwhich are required and this should definitely start improving the upcoming quarters in terms of\nperformance. On the NCD side, we are very comfortable. All our liabilities are serviced very\ncomfortably. The company maintains very healthy liquidity. We always carry roughly about 2.5-\n3x of whatever the internal thresholds on the liquidity that has been laid out.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nS K Debnath: Thank you.\nModerator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Aviral Jain from Siguler Guff. Please\ngo ahead.\nAviral Jain: Hi, Ashish, good evening. I have two questions. One is, what is your expectations on\ndisbursement pickup? What is the quantum that we can expect going forward for the balance 2\nmonths of Q3 and Q4? And given the behavior of the book, given X-bucket collection efficiency\nat 98.5%, what is the expectation of the credit cost for the rest of the year, Q3 and Q4\nspecifically?\nAshish Damani: Hi, good evening, Aviral and thanks for the questions. The way it seems like is the disbursement\nis picking up. The industry is facing a challenge on the new customer acquisition; the rejection\nrates have been higher. However, I think with our focus on fixing all, relatively speaking, the\nchallenges that we have been facing on the IT or on the operations side, we are very confident\nthat we should start delivering over Rs. 500 crores in the current quarter and the next quarter,\nour run rate should be something around Rs. 700 plus crores on a monthly basis for the next\nquarter. In terms of credit cost, things have started improving. Like you would have noticed,\nroughly about 2.5%-3% was the flow rate from the current bucket earlier. It is down to 1.5%.\nAnd again, we are confident that as the percentage of new book improves in the balance sheet,\nthis should start sustaining over 99%, which would mean that your flows into the subsequent\nbucket should slow down significantly. And that should have a very positive bearing on the\noverall credit cost that we have. I think currently we have about Rs. 150 crores, which is there\nin the 30-90 bucket. So, I am not expecting flows to be anything more than that during the quarter\ninto the bucket compared to the Rs. 360 crores of flows that we have seen in the last quarter.\nAviral Jain: This is forward flow to 90+ you are saying, right Ashish?\nAshish Damani: That is right.\nModerator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mayank Mistry from JM Financial.\nPlease go ahead.\nMayank Mistry: Hi, sir. Thanks for the opportunity. Sir, question is mainly on the collection efficiency in Bihar\nstate. So, as I was seeing the 20 bps, there is some improvement in the collection efficiency. I\nwas seeing that in Bihar, there is a 10-bps decline in the collection efficiency. And I would like\nto know how is this panning out even in October because given that the elections are nearing,\nhow would we see this going forward? Mainly your experience from the other states if that could\nhelp? And secondly, on the plus three lender base, considering that the write-offs have been\nreally elevated over the last few quarters. I would like to know from this, is it mainly coming in\nfrom this 17% book? And the 23% that has been going on from February onwards. So, should\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nwe see the write-off continuing in maybe next quarter or how should we look at it? These are\nmy questions?\nAshish Damani: So, on the first question, Bihar has been performing strongly for us. It has been at 98.8% like we\npresented. And I think in October also, we have a similar number for Bihar. So, while I\nunderstand there has been upcoming elections, our approach has been measured not just in Bihar,\nbut across the country in terms of disbursements, which is what we are controlling right now.\nAnd the outcome so far has been positive, Mayank. In terms of three lenders and the performance\nthere, yes, the customers who have more number of loans have shown higher delinquencies\nacross the buckets. However, as we start taking measures on increasing the new customers from\nthe buckets where either they have only 1 loan or 2 loans at best, this number should keep going\ndown for Spandana like it has gone down in this quarter. And I think the positive rub-off will be\nseen across the buckets in terms of the collection efficiency.\nMayank Mistry: Sir, can you give me a number of the 17%? How much would be in Stage-II or Stage-III? Any\ncolor on this book?\nAshish Damani: I don't have that number handy right now, but Mayank, we can connect and we will definitely\nshare these numbers with you.\nMayank Mistry: Sure, sir. And how do you see the growth in second half? You said that the disbursements would\ngrow, we understand. But given that, now, should we see the positive growth from Q3 onwards\non a sequential basis?\nAshish Damani: So, there should be improvement in the AUM for sure. However, for the full year, compared to\nlast year, it should be more flattish is what I feel.\nMayank Mistry: Thanks. Thanks a lot. All the best.\nModerator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Meghna Luthra from Incred Equities.\nPlease go ahead, ma'am.\nMeghna Luthra: hi. Thank you, sir, for the opportunity. I had a couple of questions. Firstly, sir, can you explain\na little on the Rs. 86 crores technical provisions? That is not a part of the write-offs, right?\nAshish Damani: Yes, that is right. It is just a nuance that we wanted to highlight that since we have done the\nwrite-offs, we had to take this additional 20%. If we would have left it in the GNPA, probably\nthat cost would have not been incurred right now. We have been practicing a higher write-offs\npresently, and which led to this incremental cost of Rs. 86 crores.\nMeghna Luthra: Because I wasn't sure how do I differentiate this from the 418?\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nAshish Damani: No, it is a subset.\nMeghna Luthra: It is a subset. Understood. So, it is probably not due, overdue to be written off and then you did\nprudential write-offs?\nAshish Damani: No, it is a technical. So, when we do this, we are expecting the field to continue to make all the\nefforts in a regular course of business.\nMeghna Luthra: Thank you. And a couple of more questions. On the slide where this is the breakup of a customer,\nslide 7, there is a breakup of eligible customers at 10 lakh, right, which is 43% and 7% is\nserviced. So, is it fair to understand that this 43% is not serviced and these are ex-customers?\nAshish Damani: A part of them will be ex-customers, roughly about 2 lakhs, but others are active loans with me\nand when we do the scrub, they are all eligible as per my internal filters.\nMeghna Luthra: So, sir, what proportion of this entire, only 2 lakhs will be, you mean to say will be ex-customers\nwhich are not on the books, right?\nAshish Damani: That is right.\nMeghna Luthra: Because this service in H1, you mean to say there were fresh disbursals to 7% in H1?\nAshish Damani: Yes. So, last quarter, we have shown 50% customer base, which was all eligible. I think of that\n7% were given new loans during H1 and the rest, we still have about 43%where we can lend as\nper our internal rules.\nMeghna Luthra: Understood. So, it would be fair to also understand that the borrower count can further go down\nby, do you see like a number in the next, till second half?\nAshish Damani: I think it should go up as we have started pushing our customer acquisition. The member\nacquisition should push a higher customer base and over time, you should start seeing this\nnumber constantly improving.\nMeghna Luthra: So, that can start happening from Q3 itself?\nAshish Damani: So, I think if you look at that slide 6, we would have given the new customer enrollment. We\nhave 22% of the loans were given to the new customers. I think in Q1, it was 15% and this\nquarter, it was 22%. This number will be pushed further is what I was trying to explain.\nMeghna Luthra: Understood. And sir, lastly, I know it is a farsighted, but can you indicate a quarter where you\ncan see operating profit?\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nAshish Damani: Yes. So, we should start seeing in coming quarters. Like we have explained, as the pressure on\nthe GNPA eases up, which is what we are likely to see next quarter, we should start seeing first\nPPOP and then also operating profits.\nMeghna Luthra: Got it. And lastly sir, which state right now, amongst all states, is still yet to catch up with the\ncollection efficiency being, say in the 98%-99% or above percentage, , which state is lagging?\nAshish Damani: So, yes, there is not much of a lag now. Most of the states have come up to speed in terms of the\nnational average, very close to the national average. But if you were to ask me, Andhra Pradesh,\nfor example, has seen some floods and some other challenges. So, more improvement is what\nwe are expecting there.\nMeghna Luthra: And on the covenant front, I guess there would not be any further breaches or anything left, right,\non any of the borrowings?\nAshish Damani: I think we are very comfortable, as things start improving, these challenges for the organization\nshould start subsiding.\nMeghna Luthra: Got it. Thank you so much, sir.\nModerator: Thank you, ma'am. Our next question comes from the line of Rahul Mishra from RTL\nInvestment. Please go ahead, sir.\nRahul Mishra: Hi, Ashish. Thanks for taking my questions. First, any deliberation and thoughts on going down\nthe CGFMU route?\nAshish Damani: Hi, Rahul. Thanks for the question. Yes, we have been deliberating this and internally have\nstarted looking at it. As we understand, the CGFMU is favorable when you have to assume that\nyour overall, loss rate on a pool of loans is beyond 5%. That is when it is effective. However,\nwe are deliberating and positively conclude on this one way or the other in the coming quarter.\nRahul Mishra: Because I guess more than the cost and we understand that probably now may not be the right\ntime because we are just starting to recover, but just from a longer term, more predictable credit\ncosts, that is something which at least most of the players seem to be going down, whether they\nare small finance banks or specialist MFIs. So, just wanted to check that? Secondly, I know you\nhave been asked about this quarter and next quarter. But let us say, FY '26 has been what FY '26\nhas been. Looking out at FY '27, what do you think is, both AUM growth and credit costs that\nwould make you feel satisfied?\nAshish Damani: Yes. So, I can give you only a guesstimate at this point in time, Rahul. But I think what we can\nachieve is, 20% kind of a growth rate. And the credit cost in my mind should not be over 3%. It\nshould be more like a 2.5%-3% kind of a credit cost. Things have started looking up on the X\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nbucket, whether I call it X bucket or when I look at the new portfolio under the new guardrails\nor the new credit filters that we have put has been behaving very strongly at 99.9, even for\nOctober for that matter. Gives us a lot of confidence that the path to recovery in the microfinance\nasset class has kicked off and from here on, it should only improve is how I kind of look ahead.\nRahul Mishra: Understood. And finally, any new senior hires and any update on the MD CEO?\nAshish Damani: So, senior hires, yes, we have hired earlier Head of FRM who has moved into the CRO role. So,\nthat is one hire that we have done. MD CEO, I think it is a UPSI, but we should be positively be\nmaking a formal announcement to the exchanges within next 30 days.\nRahul Mishra: That is very helpful. Thank you so much for answering my questions.\nModerator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Ashlesh Sonje from Kotak Securities.\nPlease go ahead.\nAshlesh Sonje: Hi, Ashish. Good evening. Sir, a few questions. Firstly, in your book, because of these MFIN\nguardrails, how are you looking at the trends on borrower rejection rates now? Is that trend\ngradually declining month after month?\nAshish Damani: Hi, Ashlesh. Good evening. So, the trend continues to be high. If I have to split it out between\nexisting and new member acquisition that we do, the new member acquisition is hovering around\n80% in terms of rejection. And the existing also we are seeing close to about 65% or thereabouts\nin terms of rejection. So, yes, it is high. Having said that, for us, a part of this is also because of\nlot of internal filters that we have put, like as explaining in the new customer acquisition, we are\nvery stringent. We are looking at zero delinquency. One day delinquency is also knocked off.\nWe are very stringent even for the existing customers and we are pegging at 30 days, although\nthe SRO allows you to go up to 60 days in terms of delinquency. So, these matrices also have a\nrole to play. But yes, I think we are comfortable given the portfolio quality being top class right\nnow.\nAshlesh Sonje: And you would have any sense on when these rejection rates could normalize or is it too difficult\nto predict right now?\nAshish Damani: Yes, it is difficult. But I think the way we are looking at it is we just need to step up the new\ncustomer acquisition on a continuous basis going to geographies where there are still white\npatches or green patches and make effort to add. There is a clear headroom there in terms of\nimproving productivity at a LO level and that is our focus area for us.\nAshlesh Sonje: Understood. And secondly, you mentioned that the October collection level is a bit relatively\nmuted as compared to September because of festive and some floods. Can you just list out which\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nare the states where there has been a flood impact and if you have seen anything specific in the\nstate of MP?\nAshish Damani: So, floods, like I told you, Andhra Pradesh has seen pockets where there was flooding. We have\nseen in pockets in Bihar, parts of Odisha and West Bengal are the states. Sorry, your second part\nof the question was MP?\nAshlesh Sonje: Yes, sir.\nAshish Damani: Nothing specific, we have seen. In fact, I am not sure if I have covered that, but MP in terms of\ncollection efficiency has been strong. We continue to see 98.9% kind of X-bucket collection\nefficiency there and disbursement also has been reasonable. In fact, in our case, MP, I think as\na percentage has stepped up from 12% odd to 14% now of the total balance sheet.\nAshlesh Sonje: Understood, sir. And lastly, now that the guardrails have had their desired effect of curtailing\nleverage in the industry, is there any discussion at the industry level or at MFIN level to loosen\nthe guardrails from here because the industry seems to be in a better position today.\nAshish Damani: Again, too early. I think the industry is still evaluating the impact. Given the positive impact on\nthe portfolio quality, maybe, as an industry, we would probably wait a little more for us to\nanalyze what is the negative impact on, let us say, the growth or other areas and then recalibrate.\nHaving said that, are there discussions? Yes, there have been deliberations, nothing concrete to\nmy knowledge has been actioned or has been initiated.\nAshlesh Sonje: Understood, sir. Thank you very much for the responses.\nModerator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Vatsal Parag Shah from Knightstone\nCapital Management. Please go ahead, sir.\nVatsal Parag Shah: Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. So, can you just quantify the slippages for\nthis quarter and last quarter?\nAshish Damani: Yes, sure, Vatsal. We will give you the number. Just give us a moment. So, it was Rs. 552 crores\nfor the Q1 and Rs. 396 crores for Q2.\nVatsal Parag Shah: Got it. And secondly, can you mention what is going on in the Criss Financial AUM, like where\nhas that reached? I think in last year Q4, it was around Rs. 230 crores and hence, we have not\nreceived any update on that?\nAshish Damani: Yes, sure. So, I have my colleague who manages the Criss Financial business, Sushanta Tripathy.\nI will just ask him to update you on what is going on.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nSushanta Tripathy: Yes. Hi, this is Sushanta. I take care of the Criss Financial. So, Criss Financial, we have\nunsecured individual loan and we have the LAP book, Micro LAP. So, put together, we have a\nportfolio of Rs. 671 crores business in total. So, our unsecured individual loan is the rural\nsegment AP, Telangana that we are operating. And the LAP, we have another 6 states we are\noperating, Rajasthan, MP, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and AP, Telangana. So, unsecured individual\nloan, that there is the AP, Telangana, as we mentioned, there is a flood, attrition, other stress are\nthere. So, the portfolio quality is not behaving in line with the other segment like Micro LAP.\nMicro LAP, whatever we have launched, Rs. 290 crore book that is going perfectly fine. We\nhave very less slippages there, less than 1% NPA kind of thing. And that we plan to grow a lot.\nThe journey in the Criss Financial is currently we are the 39% of the portfolio in secured, which\nwas a year back 13% portfolio in secured in this financial that has become 39%-40%. We plan\nto take it to upwards of 50%-55% by year end. So, going forward, the major focus in Criss\nFinancial will be the secured part lending to the Micro LAP segment and reduce the\nconcentration in the unsecured element. So, that is the journey that we envisage. We have good\nbranch network in the Micro LAP, 100 branches are there. Those have started yielding results in\nterms of the productivity and we will grow that book very strong in the coming quarters.\nVatsal Parag Shah: Got it. That was clear. Just one thing, the overall book was around Rs. 670 crores and out of that\nMicro LAP was around Rs. 300 crores, right?\nSushanta Tripathy: Yes. Correct.\nVatsal Parag Shah: So, the overall book will grow or you are going to degrow the unsecured part?\nSushanta Tripathy: No. So, the unsecured part, we will grow. I am saying the proportion of the LAP book will grow,\nbut among that the unsecured part will remain stable or little marginal growth will be there. The\njourney from year to year down the line, we tend to have 70-30 kind of proportion in the book.\nAshish Damani: So, in the immediate run, Vatsal, the way we look at it is, probably individual book will also\ngrow and LAP will also grow. Proportionately, LAP will grow more and over time, like Sushanta\nis saying, the strategy is to keep pushing the secured business and change the balance sheet to a\n70-30 kind of a ratio.\nVatsal Parag Shah: Got it. And have you taken any price hikes in the group loan business?\nAshish Damani: Yes. So, across the group, we have seen increase in interest rates. For Criss, we are at 26% in\nterms of the interest rate and 1.5% as processing fee.\nVatsal Parag Shah: And any price hikes in the microfinance business, the JLG model?\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 31, 2025\nAshish Damani: Yes, we have highlighted on page 4, if you see now our pricing will be from 23%-26%,\ndepending upon, which the aging or the vintage of the client with Spandana. And 1.5% is the\nprocessing fee, which used to be at 1%.\nVatsal Parag Shah: Got it. That is very clear.\nModerator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, due to the time constraint, that was the last question for\ntoday. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Ashish Damani for the closing comments.\nAshish Damani: Thank you once again, everyone for joining the call. Like always, we are open to feedback or\nany further clarification questions, which we could not take today. The team and all of us here\nare available for any further clarification. Thank you all and good day to all of you. Thank you\nvery much.\nModerator: Thank you, sir. On behalf of Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited, that concludes this\nconference. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines.\n"

Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI now hand the conference over to Mr. Ashish Damani, Interim CEO, CFO and President. Thank\nyou, and over to you, sir.\nAshish Damani: Thank you for joining in this evening with us for this call. Let me take this opportunity to wish\nyou in advance a very happy 79th Independence Day. Our apologies, I think for some technical\nchallenges, the presentation would have just got uploaded a few minutes back. So I'm not sure\nif everybody got a chance to go through the presentation in detail. In any case, I would try to\ncover all the highlights from the presentation in my opening remarks.\nAs you all know, we have announced in the last results, in fact, in Q3 results that we would like\nto go for capital raise, which was confidence capital that we talked about. Post the\nannouncement, we have set the capital raise process in motion, and I'm pleased to announce that\nwe have successfully closed the INR 400 crore rights issue on 11th of August 2025.\nThe issue saw full participation from the promoters, and there was a slight increment from the\ninstitutional investors as well. We had seen good participation coming in from retail investors\nas well. This equity will strengthen Spandana's capital structure and the CRAR has now\nimproved to 46% on a consol basis from 40.8%, which is what we had at end of June.\nWe've been maintaining a conservative posture with regard to liquidity, given that there have\nbeen a challenging external operating environment over the past few quarters. And you would\nhave noticed that we've been maintaining a very healthy liquidity to address this concern.\nWe had INR 1,731 crores of liquidity at the end of June '25, and we continue to maintain\nsufficient headroom on this aspect. Microfinance industry is very gradually moving towards\nstability.. You would have also checked, I mean, if you had a chance, that our x bucket collection\nefficiency, while it dipped slightly in April and May, it reverted back to 98% in June and\nimproved further to 98.5% in July.\nWe have implemented stricter guardrails 2.0 credit rules from January 2025, while I think some\nof the peers would have taken up this starting April 2025. Spandana's approach has been very\nselective about lending to the customers. The new loans disbursed post January 2025 or since\nApril have been performing extremely well, owing to this conservatism that we have built into\nthe business.\nIn terms of numbers, the current book for whatever was disbursed since January in the last\nfinancial year was at 95.6%, whereas if you look at the current year disbursements, it is trending\nat around 100% in terms of current book. We are taking a number of steps to strengthen our\nprocesses, and we are also taking a number of steps towards improving collections from the\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\noverdue buckets. We have been maintaining more than 500 strong dedicated collection team,\nwhich is engaged with the customers to recover overdue amounts.\nYou will notice in the presentation that we have collected INR 41 crores in the current quarter\nas well compared to INR 52 crores in Q4FY25 from the overdue buckets. We have also initiated\nefforts focused on engaging with the customers through telecalling, engaging them by sending\nSMS with digital links so that they can make payments directly. Typically, the customers who\ndo not engage are migrated, and that is where these SMS with the payment links are very useful\nand helpful. We have started sending this on a regular interval basis.\nIn addition, we are also initiating some legal actions by like sending notices or by filing Lok\nAdalat wherever necessary. There have been some encouraging movement that we have seen\npost these actions. So while recovery efforts are going on in the field, our teams are also working\nhard to bring in product, process and technology level changes to ensure stronger controls with\nregard to underwriting of new loans.\nWe have done multiple enhancements in the customer journey, including introduction of\nliveliness checks at various stages, compulsory house visits, which are now corroborated with\ntechnology in terms of validation and through geotagging.\nWe are also doing welcome calling to ensure that the customer is aware. We have introduced e-\nsigning to improve the entire documentation process around the loans. We have also made some\nchanges in our SOP like accepting bank statements that are at least 90 days in operation,\nincreasing cooling off period between 2 loan products, doing upfront CB checks to enable faster\nprocessing of loans.\nAll these changes, we believe, will help us not just simplify processes, but also to increase\ncustomer convenience, while at the same time, ensure quality onboarding and underwriting. Our\ndata analytic efforts are also focused on identifying pool of existing customers to extend loans\nto. Regular update in the system is being done to drive focused approach at a field officer level\nin terms of engaging with customers who are eligible for further loans.\nWe have disclosed in our presentation about 50% of our existing customers and some dormant\ncustomers are eligible for fresh loans as per our stricter internal lending norms. About 85% of\nthese identified customers have less than INR 1 lakh as credit exposure, while 65% of them also\nhave a vintage of over 2 years with us, thereby providing us with a sufficient right to play and\nbuild a strong, long-lasting relationship with them.\nLet me move on to the regular business update and cover some numbers for you. As explained\nearlier, our efforts during the quarter were directed towards improving systems process with a\nfocus on efficiencies and better credit underwriting. Our disbursement for the quarter, thereby\nwas trending low at INR 280 crores.\nHowever, with key parts of our planned systems and processes improvements in place, we are\nconfident and we have also started seeing increase in the pace of disbursements with July number\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\nalone recording disbursements of INR 265 crores against the INR 280 crores disbursed in the\nentire quarter of Q1.\nAUM at the end of Q1 was at INR 4,958 crores, a drop of 27% quarter-on-quarter. As you all\nunderstand, AUM is an outcome of disbursements, and we are confident once the operating\nenvironment stabilizes, and our systems are rolling, we will be able to grow a quality book very\nquickly.\nLet me cover some highlights on the portfolio quality. You would have noticed that the\nenvironment has been stabilizing and top 5 states numbers have been provided in the\npresentation. You will notice that we are seeing an improving trend in the top 5 states for\ncollection efficiency on the X bucket.\nWe continue to maintain our provisioning at 80%, which we believe is among the highest in the\nindustry. GNPA stands at 5.49%, a decrease of 14 bps quarter-on-quarter. Stand-alone GNPA,\nhowever, was flat at 4.88%. Likewise, our NNPA for the quarter was at 1.15% a 4 bps decline\nover the March numbers.\nStand-alone NNPA was, , at 0.96%, which is flat. With a comfortable liquidity position of about\nINR 2,030 crores at the beginning of the quarter and a muted disbursements, our funding\nrequirements were met through available liquidity during the quarter. And we had a very strong\nclosing liquidity position of INR 1,731 crores.\nQ1 FY '26 financial performance, let me just give you quick highlights around this. The net\ninterest income for the quarter was INR 113 crores over INR 425 crores reported in Q1 of last\nyear. NII was lower by 43% over the last quarter. The decline in NII was primarily due to the\ndecline in AUM and the interest reversals that we have seen on account of flows. Our PPOP was\nnegative INR 59 crores. However, with disbursements improving and continued rationalization\nin our operations on the cost side, we expect the PPOP to turn positive in the coming quarters.\nYield on the portfolio was lower at 19.4% for the quarter as against 20.7% in the previous\nquarter. The decline in the yield is primarily on account of the reversals again and should get\ncorrected as the disbursements start picking up. The company reported a net loss of INR 360\ncrores for the quarter on account of higher provisions, additional credit cost of INR 131 crores\nrecognized in Q1 FY '26 due to technical write-off.\nExcluding this, the impairment cost would have been at INR 291 crores. We see FY '26 as a year\nof rebuilding. We are relooking at every system and process for improvements. While our\ndisbursements were low during the quarter, the performance of the loans disbursed during this\nperiod with the new credit rules provide us with the confidence for the way forward.\nWhile we'll continue to maintain a cautious stand, we are also aware of the need of our customers\nfor the working capital and all these requirements shall be met as long as the customers comply\nwith the credit rule engine that we have set out. With this, I'll close my opening remarks here\nand open the floor for questions.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\nModerator: Thank you very much. Our first question comes from the line of Mahrukh Adajania from\nNuvama. Please go ahead.\nMahrukh Adajania: I had a couple of questions. Firstly, that you've shown a slide of forward flows, a chart on forward\nflows. So they're still higher than April. When do you see the forward flows easing? And when\ndo you see a return to profitability?\nAshish Damani: Hi, Mahrukh, thanks for the questions. So forward flows, yes, you're right. The forward flows\nfor the GNPA bucket has been higher, which is at 85%. But if you look at what will drive this\nreally is the flows from the top have to be curtailed. We have seen improvement in our current\nbucket and it stacks at about 98.5% in July. This will limit the flows into the 1 to 30 or subsequent\nbuckets.\nOnce you have a palatable number, I'm sure we will start seeing much better collection\nefficiencies in the subsequent buckets as well. Right now, it is a overwhelming number, which\nis stacking up in these buckets, and that's why the percentages which we can hold back or which\nwe can reverse are hovering around that 30%.\nMahrukh Adajania: So this is likely to continue for, say, 1 to 2 quarters? Will it improve by the fourth quarter?\nWhat's your best assessment?\nAshish Damani: Yes. I think it will take one more quarter. But from third quarter onwards, we should see a better\nperformance on all the buckets.\nMahrukh Adajania: So forward flows will ease in all buckets.\nAshish Damani: That's right.\nMahrukh Adajania: And what would be your disbursement target, if any, be for the full year? And if at all, you have\nan AUM growth guidance?\nAshish Damani: So we've talked about the AUM growth last quarter as well. We are looking at around 20% as a\nnumber for the full year growth. Having said that, the environment has been evolving. And we\nwould like to be cautious while things are still evolving. However, existing customers, we will\ndefinitely meet their requirements, like we have explained in the presentation, 50% of the\nborrowers are eligible as we speak, even when we apply all the stricter norms on the credit rule.\nSo we have sufficient play here to build the book. And I think we should be able to achieve this\n20% growth number as guided.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Sucrit Patil from Eyesight Fintrade Private Limited.\nSucrit Patil: I have a question to Mr. Damani. As Spandana scales in non-South markets and deepen the\ndigital engagement, how are you thinking about evolving the operations model, possibly\nintegrating alternate data, psychometric scoring or embedded fintech partnerships to underwrite\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\nnew borrower cohorts and reduce seasonality linked volatility? Is there a road map to build a\nmore predictive pan-India credit engine beyond the traditional microfinance?\nAshish Damani: Thanks, Sucrit for the question. We have done a lot of analysis internally, and we have worked\nwith even the credit bureaus to understand if there is a suitable credit scoring model or credit\nscores, which can be used to do the underwriting. Unfortunately, the regression analysis kind of\nthrows up no pattern as such. Even at the highest scores, you have a bad rate, which is very high.\nAnd there are new to credit customers who show actually much better performance.\nSo it's a mixed kind of analysis that we've been able to see. I think the right way to look at it is\nit has to be a combination of credit score and some of the other aspects which are nuanced to,\nlet's say, the activity, geography, which will have to go into this. So not immediately, but in\nfuture, definitely, we will like to have a scoring model, which is in-house developed, taking into\naccount all of these aspects.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Abhijit Tibrewal from Motilal Oswal.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Ashish, I'm just trying to understand 2 things here. First things first, , while there are many\nplayers today in the MFI industry who have started to call out that operationally, the things have\nnormalized, right? And what we are seeing today in those companies today is more, , the P&L\npain from the last few quarters. which you also highlighted that the current bucket collection\nefficiency for the new disbursements are holding up well.\nI remember in your opening remarks, you suggested almost 100%. So what I'm trying to\nunderstand is from -- I don't want to use the word legacy, but basically, what about the old book,\nwhich is there, For how many quarters in your assessment is the pain going to linger for us? And\nI remember a previous participant also asking you that in your internal assessment, when is it\nthat we can start reporting a positive PPOP and a positive PAT?\nAshish Damani: Yes. I think one more quarter is what we believe there will be a pain. If you look at our lending\nand this will hold true for most of the microfinance entities,the weighted average maturity of the\nloans will hover around for Spandana, it is presently at 6.7 because the disbursements have been\nlow. But on a normalized basis also, it is never beyond 9.5, 10 months.\nSo technically speaking, any pain or any churn of the book should not take more than 4 quarters.\nAnd I think we are already down 3 quarters in the pain. So that way, for the churn to happen, it\nshould not take more than a quarter from here is my understanding. And in terms of profitability,\n, one more quarter is what we see is pain, but thereafter, we should see better numbers for\nSpandana.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. And sir, I remember in your opening remarks again, you made a remark around FY '26\nwill be a year of rebuilding. And I remember speaking to you about this earlier that, very clearly,\nright, from that peak of close to INR 12,000 crores in AUM we've seen very sharp decline. So\nlike you rightly said, second quarter, the AUM could come down further. But third quarter\nonwards, which is second half of this fiscal year onwards, we are expecting we'll start rebuilding.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\nWhen I say we'll start rebuilding. From there onwards, do you expect that at least Q-o-Q, we\nwill start reporting a growth in AUM?\nAshish Damani: Growth in the AUM. Yes, yes. That's right.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: That's right. And lastly, sir, earlier in the call, you said we are still guiding for a 20% AUM\ngrowth this year. That would essentially mean disbursements have to normalize and really\naccelerate in the second half for us to deliver a 20% growth in AUM. Is that how you are\nbasically thinking about it?\nAnd a subpart to this question where you said that maybe one more quarter of pain and third\nquarter onwards, things can start normalizing. So when we say start normalizing in a normalized\nscenario, what would credit costs be like? And sir, why I ask is today, when we speak to leaders\nlike you, everyone has a different view on the MFI industry.\nThere are leaders who are saying that the JLG is not working, then there are leaders in the MFI\nindustry who say that, \"Hey, the JLG model is still very much working. It needs to be tweaked\na little bit given how things are, given how borrowers are.” So what is your assessment? And in\nthis new normal, which in your assessment will start from third quarter, what could be likely\ncredit costs?\nAshish Damani: Yes. So I can answer the credit cost question for a BAU basis. For the current year, it is still\nevolving. So I would not like to reflect on that. But on a BAU basis, the new normal for\nmicrofinance industry should be anywhere between 2.5% to 3% in terms of credit cost. That's\nthe new normal. And the reason for this, Abhijit, is largely because the reality is somewhere in\nbetween.\nWhile the joint liability has weakened, it is still something that needs to be used as a tool to have\nright operating cost and to have the right model in terms of servicing the large customer base,\nwhich microfinance kind of services. So things have evolved, changed over time. Things like\ndigital collections have picked up. Even for Spandana, it is now trending at around 14%\ncompared to what used to be more like 3% to 4%. So things are evolving and that's why I think\n2.5%, 3% would be the new normal.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. And sir, if I can just squeeze in one last question for franchises like us, given that the\nAUM has run down, the opex continues to remain elevated, which are essentially fixed costs,\nthe employees that we have on board. So I'm just trying to understand till the time that AUM\nscales up, right, how are we thinking about opex in the near term, maybe the next couple of\nquarters? Is there an intent to kind of let's say, when people leave, right, there's normal attrition.\nSo we'll just let it be, right, and not replace them\nAshish Damani: You're right. Sorry to stop you there, but I get the question. How is that we are going to look at\nproductivity and overall employee cost to play out in the near future, if that's the question,\nAbhijit? So I think if you look at our last 3 quarters, we were at 19,808 as number of employees\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\nwent down to 18,382 in March, went down to 15,574 in June of '25. So we are focusing on\noperational efficiencies on the ground.\nWe have also merged about 81 branches, and we will look at more improvements on the footprint\nand align it with the rundown in the AUM that we have seen. So yes, operating cost is one of\nthe areas where the focus isand if there is an attrition, we will be very watchful in terms of\nreplacing or backfilling the employee base in only those geographies where there is a need to\nfrom a productivity metrics perspective.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashlesh Sonje from Kotak Securities.\nAshlesh Sonje: The first question is on Slide number 6 in your presentation, where you show lender overlap.\nOut of this 21%, which is exposed to Spandana plus 3 or more, how much of this would be\nalready delinquent in 0 plus?\nAshish Damani: Sorry, I don't have that number handy, but just to give you a similar data point, the Spandana\nplus 3 borrowers over a period of time have contributed about 30% in our GNPA in the past. So\nthey definitely are far more delinquent compared to the rest of the buckets. For this standing\n21%, we'll just come back to you.\nBut we have given another slide where it gives us an idea into what kind of percentage of\ncustomers are, delinquent across Spandana base. So 13% of the customers are over 30 when we\nlook at the Spandana book. And the rest of the customers who are, in Spandana plus 3, but are\nvery likely to be and continued to be in current bucket as far as our book is concerned, 96% of\nthe rest of the book is current with us.\nAshlesh Sonje: Understood, sir. And you in your opening remarks, you spoke about the cooling off period. Can\nyou shed more details on that?\nAshish Damani: So earlier, we used to give customer loan after 6 months of the first loan. Now we wait for 12\nmonths before we give the second loan.\nAshlesh Sonje: And what is the typical contracted maturity of that loan for you?\nAshish Damani: We have 85% of our loans are for 2 years and roughly 15% of the loans are for 12 and 18 months.\nAshlesh Sonje: This cooling off period refers to the period after which the borrower becomes eligible for a\nreplacement loan effectively.\nAshish Damani: That's correct.\nModerator: We have a last minute registration coming from the line of Mr. Abhijit Tibrewal from Motilal\nOswal.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Sir, if I can ask you just 2 more questions. First thing is, how is our Board thinking about\nsuccession now? Since the time Shalabh sir left, what is the progress that the Board has made in\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\ncase you can share some thoughts around it, , at least how are we approaching that? If there is\nanything at all that you can share?\nAshish Damani: Yes, sure. Abhijit, I think the Board has been looking at this particular thing in great detailand I\nthink they have initiated the process some time back. So in next 30 to 45 days, we should be able\nto get this concluded.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. And sir, , the inclination is to get someone external or are there also internal candidates\nin the fray.\nAshish Damani: No. So we have discussed this last quarter, and the Board will look at both internal as well as\nexternal candidates and look at what is the best for the enterprise too.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. And lastly, sir, if you could just refresh our memories with regards to Kedaara's holding.\nI remember they were invested from a fund. They were also invested in another housing finance\ncompany from that fund, which they have already exited now.So if you could just refresh all our\nmemories, how are they placed on that, that will be very useful for all of us.\nAshish Damani: So Kedaara holds about 48.12% and 41% comes from the fund -- the old fund, Fund I of Kedaara\nand the rest comes from Fund III. And that's where they stand. And they continue to hold that\npost the rights issue as well. So very much intact in terms of their holding.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Anand Kumar Ela, an investor.\nAnand Kumar Ela: The point I was trying to ask was in July, the disbursements at INR 268 crores. How are the first\n2 weeks in August, the disbursements picking up?\nAshish Damani: Anandji. Yes, the trend has been better than what we have seen in July for the first 2 weeks. I\nthink we are still not close to our BAU or potential. I think we will take one more month. And\nfrom September onwards, we should see a very normalized kind of disbursements.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Prabal Gandhi from InCred AMC.\nPrabal Gandhi: Sir, just one question. When we see the Slide number 6, there is a mention that asset quality of\nloans disbursed under Guardrail 1 has delinquency of 4.4%. So even after implementation of\nstricter norms for us, we are still seeing delinquencies as high as 4.4% so any comments there?\nAshish Damani: I think that was Guardrail 1, which has been given out there. And at that time, I'm not sure if the\nindustry was following all the norms. So there is a possibility that while we would have selected\nthe customer, the customer went into Spandana plus 3 or higher and subsequently, the\nperformance was not as good as what we see now. That's the long and short of it, Prabal.\nPrabal Gandhi: Sir, can you share any data points with respect to say, the new disbursements that we have done\nin the last 6 months, which indicates that the delinquencies there are either lower than the\nindustry or lower than what we have seen historically, something that you can share on that, sir.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\nAshish Damani: That's the information on that Slide 6, which you're referring to. If you see whatever we have\ndisbursed in this financial year, all the loans are stacking up at 100%. And last quarter, if you\nhave to look at, that's the other number where we have said Guardrail 1+.\nPrabal Gandhi: Okay. And secondly, when we see the percentage of 3-plus lenders, despite some INR 10 billion\nprovisions in last 2 quarters, that number is quite sticky for us at 21%-22%. So ideally that\nnumber should have come down since we have written off so aggressively. Why is that number\nnot coming down for us?\nAshish Damani: The underlying is number of borrowers that are standing on a date, since there are a lot of\ncustomers who have closed their loans with us and have become dormant doesn't form part of\ndenominator or numerator here. If I were to add that, then yes, this number, like you have rightly\nsaid, would have come down.\nPrabal Gandhi: Meaning we have closed the loans for good customers?\nAshish Damani: Yes. Customers have closed their loan by repaying all the amounts. However, subsequent loan\nwas not given to them at this point in time. They remain dormant with usAnd as and when we\nstart giving them loans or disburse to them, this number will start improving. Moreover, in\nfuture, we've just started new to credit customers with us and once we start adding these\ncustomers new to credit, the denominator and this 21% number will change accordingly.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Prasanjan Mitra from RCO.\nPrasanjan Mitra: Just one question from me. What are the ways that we are tracking the new portfolio? Basically,\njust to understand if there is a way that we are looking at the old and the new portfolio separately,\nlet's say, the last 3 or 6 months, whatever we have disbursed, are they tracking significantly\ndifferent metrics as compared to the old?\nAshish Damani: No. So the tracking part is same. I think the origination or the credit appraisal when we have\nmentioned, we had much stricter norms, which cuts across both the guardrail metrices as well as\nsome internal metrices on geography, on how the center behaves and some of the aspects which\ncome from the field. So all put together is how we have looked at the origination part was very\ndifferent from what we would have done in the past.\nPrasanjan Mitra: And from an asset quality metrics, are we tracking better kind of quality on the recent portfolio?\nI mean is there a way to determine if what we are doing is working?\nAshish Damani: That's right. So that Slide 6, which we just discussed with the earlier participant, if you please\nrefer to that, the loans which have been disbursed in, fourth quarter, were trending at 95.6%\ncurrent book. And if you have to look at what has been disbursed in this financial year, it is\ntrending at 100%.\nModerator: Ladies and gentlemen, as there are no further questions, I now hand the conference over to the\nmanagement for closing comments.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\nAshish Damani: Thank you once again to all of you for joining us here this evening. We, at Spandana, the entire\nmanagement team is thankful to you for the consistent feedback that you've been providing. We\nall look forward to your continued support. And lastly, the team will always be available for any\nfurther queries or clarifications that you may have. Thank you once again.\nModerator: Thank you.

            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\nModerator: Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and welcome to the Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited Q1\nFY '26 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only\nmode and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes.\nShould you need assistance during the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing star\nand then zero on your touchtone phone. Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI now hand the conference over to Mr. Ashish Damani, Interim CEO, CFO and President. Thank\nyou, and over to you, sir.\nAshish Damani: Thank you for joining in this evening with us for this call. Let me take this opportunity to wish\nyou in advance a very happy 79th Independence Day. Our apologies, I think for some technical\nchallenges, the presentation would have just got uploaded a few minutes back. So I'm not sure\nif everybody got a chance to go through the presentation in detail. In any case, I would try to\ncover all the highlights from the presentation in my opening remarks.\nAs you all know, we have announced in the last results, in fact, in Q3 results that we would like\nto go for capital raise, which was confidence capital that we talked about. Post the\nannouncement, we have set the capital raise process in motion, and I'm pleased to announce that\nwe have successfully closed the INR 400 crore rights issue on 11th of August 2025.\nThe issue saw full participation from the promoters, and there was a slight increment from the\ninstitutional investors as well. We had seen good participation coming in from retail investors\nas well. This equity will strengthen Spandana's capital structure and the CRAR has now\nimproved to 46% on a consol basis from 40.8%, which is what we had at end of June.\nWe've been maintaining a conservative posture with regard to liquidity, given that there have\nbeen a challenging external operating environment over the past few quarters. And you would\nhave noticed that we've been maintaining a very healthy liquidity to address this concern.\nWe had INR 1,731 crores of liquidity at the end of June '25, and we continue to maintain\nsufficient headroom on this aspect. Microfinance industry is very gradually moving towards\nstability.. You would have also checked, I mean, if you had a chance, that our x bucket collection\nefficiency, while it dipped slightly in April and May, it reverted back to 98% in June and\nimproved further to 98.5% in July.\nWe have implemented stricter guardrails 2.0 credit rules from January 2025, while I think some\nof the peers would have taken up this starting April 2025. Spandana's approach has been very\nselective about lending to the customers. The new loans disbursed post January 2025 or since\nApril have been performing extremely well, owing to this conservatism that we have built into\nthe business.\nIn terms of numbers, the current book for whatever was disbursed since January in the last\nfinancial year was at 95.6%, whereas if you look at the current year disbursements, it is trending\nat around 100% in terms of current book. We are taking a number of steps to strengthen our\nprocesses, and we are also taking a number of steps towards improving collections from the\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\noverdue buckets. We have been maintaining more than 500 strong dedicated collection team,\nwhich is engaged with the customers to recover overdue amounts.\nYou will notice in the presentation that we have collected INR 41 crores in the current quarter\nas well compared to INR 52 crores in Q4FY25 from the overdue buckets. We have also initiated\nefforts focused on engaging with the customers through telecalling, engaging them by sending\nSMS with digital links so that they can make payments directly. Typically, the customers who\ndo not engage are migrated, and that is where these SMS with the payment links are very useful\nand helpful. We have started sending this on a regular interval basis.\nIn addition, we are also initiating some legal actions by like sending notices or by filing Lok\nAdalat wherever necessary. There have been some encouraging movement that we have seen\npost these actions. So while recovery efforts are going on in the field, our teams are also working\nhard to bring in product, process and technology level changes to ensure stronger controls with\nregard to underwriting of new loans.\nWe have done multiple enhancements in the customer journey, including introduction of\nliveliness checks at various stages, compulsory house visits, which are now corroborated with\ntechnology in terms of validation and through geotagging.\nWe are also doing welcome calling to ensure that the customer is aware. We have introduced e-\nsigning to improve the entire documentation process around the loans. We have also made some\nchanges in our SOP like accepting bank statements that are at least 90 days in operation,\nincreasing cooling off period between 2 loan products, doing upfront CB checks to enable faster\nprocessing of loans.\nAll these changes, we believe, will help us not just simplify processes, but also to increase\ncustomer convenience, while at the same time, ensure quality onboarding and underwriting. Our\ndata analytic efforts are also focused on identifying pool of existing customers to extend loans\nto. Regular update in the system is being done to drive focused approach at a field officer level\nin terms of engaging with customers who are eligible for further loans.\nWe have disclosed in our presentation about 50% of our existing customers and some dormant\ncustomers are eligible for fresh loans as per our stricter internal lending norms. About 85% of\nthese identified customers have less than INR 1 lakh as credit exposure, while 65% of them also\nhave a vintage of over 2 years with us, thereby providing us with a sufficient right to play and\nbuild a strong, long-lasting relationship with them.\nLet me move on to the regular business update and cover some numbers for you. As explained\nearlier, our efforts during the quarter were directed towards improving systems process with a\nfocus on efficiencies and better credit underwriting. Our disbursement for the quarter, thereby\nwas trending low at INR 280 crores.\nHowever, with key parts of our planned systems and processes improvements in place, we are\nconfident and we have also started seeing increase in the pace of disbursements with July number\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\nalone recording disbursements of INR 265 crores against the INR 280 crores disbursed in the\nentire quarter of Q1.\nAUM at the end of Q1 was at INR 4,958 crores, a drop of 27% quarter-on-quarter. As you all\nunderstand, AUM is an outcome of disbursements, and we are confident once the operating\nenvironment stabilizes, and our systems are rolling, we will be able to grow a quality book very\nquickly.\nLet me cover some highlights on the portfolio quality. You would have noticed that the\nenvironment has been stabilizing and top 5 states numbers have been provided in the\npresentation. You will notice that we are seeing an improving trend in the top 5 states for\ncollection efficiency on the X bucket.\nWe continue to maintain our provisioning at 80%, which we believe is among the highest in the\nindustry. GNPA stands at 5.49%, a decrease of 14 bps quarter-on-quarter. Stand-alone GNPA,\nhowever, was flat at 4.88%. Likewise, our NNPA for the quarter was at 1.15% a 4 bps decline\nover the March numbers.\nStand-alone NNPA was, , at 0.96%, which is flat. With a comfortable liquidity position of about\nINR 2,030 crores at the beginning of the quarter and a muted disbursements, our funding\nrequirements were met through available liquidity during the quarter. And we had a very strong\nclosing liquidity position of INR 1,731 crores.\nQ1 FY '26 financial performance, let me just give you quick highlights around this. The net\ninterest income for the quarter was INR 113 crores over INR 425 crores reported in Q1 of last\nyear. NII was lower by 43% over the last quarter. The decline in NII was primarily due to the\ndecline in AUM and the interest reversals that we have seen on account of flows. Our PPOP was\nnegative INR 59 crores. However, with disbursements improving and continued rationalization\nin our operations on the cost side, we expect the PPOP to turn positive in the coming quarters.\nYield on the portfolio was lower at 19.4% for the quarter as against 20.7% in the previous\nquarter. The decline in the yield is primarily on account of the reversals again and should get\ncorrected as the disbursements start picking up. The company reported a net loss of INR 360\ncrores for the quarter on account of higher provisions, additional credit cost of INR 131 crores\nrecognized in Q1 FY '26 due to technical write-off.\nExcluding this, the impairment cost would have been at INR 291 crores. We see FY '26 as a year\nof rebuilding. We are relooking at every system and process for improvements. While our\ndisbursements were low during the quarter, the performance of the loans disbursed during this\nperiod with the new credit rules provide us with the confidence for the way forward.\nWhile we'll continue to maintain a cautious stand, we are also aware of the need of our customers\nfor the working capital and all these requirements shall be met as long as the customers comply\nwith the credit rule engine that we have set out. With this, I'll close my opening remarks here\nand open the floor for questions.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\nModerator: Thank you very much. Our first question comes from the line of Mahrukh Adajania from\nNuvama. Please go ahead.\nMahrukh Adajania: I had a couple of questions. Firstly, that you've shown a slide of forward flows, a chart on forward\nflows. So they're still higher than April. When do you see the forward flows easing? And when\ndo you see a return to profitability?\nAshish Damani: Hi, Mahrukh, thanks for the questions. So forward flows, yes, you're right. The forward flows\nfor the GNPA bucket has been higher, which is at 85%. But if you look at what will drive this\nreally is the flows from the top have to be curtailed. We have seen improvement in our current\nbucket and it stacks at about 98.5% in July. This will limit the flows into the 1 to 30 or subsequent\nbuckets.\nOnce you have a palatable number, I'm sure we will start seeing much better collection\nefficiencies in the subsequent buckets as well. Right now, it is a overwhelming number, which\nis stacking up in these buckets, and that's why the percentages which we can hold back or which\nwe can reverse are hovering around that 30%.\nMahrukh Adajania: So this is likely to continue for, say, 1 to 2 quarters? Will it improve by the fourth quarter?\nWhat's your best assessment?\nAshish Damani: Yes. I think it will take one more quarter. But from third quarter onwards, we should see a better\nperformance on all the buckets.\nMahrukh Adajania: So forward flows will ease in all buckets.\nAshish Damani: That's right.\nMahrukh Adajania: And what would be your disbursement target, if any, be for the full year? And if at all, you have\nan AUM growth guidance?\nAshish Damani: So we've talked about the AUM growth last quarter as well. We are looking at around 20% as a\nnumber for the full year growth. Having said that, the environment has been evolving. And we\nwould like to be cautious while things are still evolving. However, existing customers, we will\ndefinitely meet their requirements, like we have explained in the presentation, 50% of the\nborrowers are eligible as we speak, even when we apply all the stricter norms on the credit rule.\nSo we have sufficient play here to build the book. And I think we should be able to achieve this\n20% growth number as guided.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Sucrit Patil from Eyesight Fintrade Private Limited.\nSucrit Patil: I have a question to Mr. Damani. As Spandana scales in non-South markets and deepen the\ndigital engagement, how are you thinking about evolving the operations model, possibly\nintegrating alternate data, psychometric scoring or embedded fintech partnerships to underwrite\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\nnew borrower cohorts and reduce seasonality linked volatility? Is there a road map to build a\nmore predictive pan-India credit engine beyond the traditional microfinance?\nAshish Damani: Thanks, Sucrit for the question. We have done a lot of analysis internally, and we have worked\nwith even the credit bureaus to understand if there is a suitable credit scoring model or credit\nscores, which can be used to do the underwriting. Unfortunately, the regression analysis kind of\nthrows up no pattern as such. Even at the highest scores, you have a bad rate, which is very high.\nAnd there are new to credit customers who show actually much better performance.\nSo it's a mixed kind of analysis that we've been able to see. I think the right way to look at it is\nit has to be a combination of credit score and some of the other aspects which are nuanced to,\nlet's say, the activity, geography, which will have to go into this. So not immediately, but in\nfuture, definitely, we will like to have a scoring model, which is in-house developed, taking into\naccount all of these aspects.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Abhijit Tibrewal from Motilal Oswal.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Ashish, I'm just trying to understand 2 things here. First things first, , while there are many\nplayers today in the MFI industry who have started to call out that operationally, the things have\nnormalized, right? And what we are seeing today in those companies today is more, , the P&L\npain from the last few quarters. which you also highlighted that the current bucket collection\nefficiency for the new disbursements are holding up well.\nI remember in your opening remarks, you suggested almost 100%. So what I'm trying to\nunderstand is from -- I don't want to use the word legacy, but basically, what about the old book,\nwhich is there, For how many quarters in your assessment is the pain going to linger for us? And\nI remember a previous participant also asking you that in your internal assessment, when is it\nthat we can start reporting a positive PPOP and a positive PAT?\nAshish Damani: Yes. I think one more quarter is what we believe there will be a pain. If you look at our lending\nand this will hold true for most of the microfinance entities,the weighted average maturity of the\nloans will hover around for Spandana, it is presently at 6.7 because the disbursements have been\nlow. But on a normalized basis also, it is never beyond 9.5, 10 months.\nSo technically speaking, any pain or any churn of the book should not take more than 4 quarters.\nAnd I think we are already down 3 quarters in the pain. So that way, for the churn to happen, it\nshould not take more than a quarter from here is my understanding. And in terms of profitability,\n, one more quarter is what we see is pain, but thereafter, we should see better numbers for\nSpandana.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. And sir, I remember in your opening remarks again, you made a remark around FY '26\nwill be a year of rebuilding. And I remember speaking to you about this earlier that, very clearly,\nright, from that peak of close to INR 12,000 crores in AUM we've seen very sharp decline. So\nlike you rightly said, second quarter, the AUM could come down further. But third quarter\nonwards, which is second half of this fiscal year onwards, we are expecting we'll start rebuilding.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\nWhen I say we'll start rebuilding. From there onwards, do you expect that at least Q-o-Q, we\nwill start reporting a growth in AUM?\nAshish Damani: Growth in the AUM. Yes, yes. That's right.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: That's right. And lastly, sir, earlier in the call, you said we are still guiding for a 20% AUM\ngrowth this year. That would essentially mean disbursements have to normalize and really\naccelerate in the second half for us to deliver a 20% growth in AUM. Is that how you are\nbasically thinking about it?\nAnd a subpart to this question where you said that maybe one more quarter of pain and third\nquarter onwards, things can start normalizing. So when we say start normalizing in a normalized\nscenario, what would credit costs be like? And sir, why I ask is today, when we speak to leaders\nlike you, everyone has a different view on the MFI industry.\nThere are leaders who are saying that the JLG is not working, then there are leaders in the MFI\nindustry who say that, \"Hey, the JLG model is still very much working. It needs to be tweaked\na little bit given how things are, given how borrowers are.” So what is your assessment? And in\nthis new normal, which in your assessment will start from third quarter, what could be likely\ncredit costs?\nAshish Damani: Yes. So I can answer the credit cost question for a BAU basis. For the current year, it is still\nevolving. So I would not like to reflect on that. But on a BAU basis, the new normal for\nmicrofinance industry should be anywhere between 2.5% to 3% in terms of credit cost. That's\nthe new normal. And the reason for this, Abhijit, is largely because the reality is somewhere in\nbetween.\nWhile the joint liability has weakened, it is still something that needs to be used as a tool to have\nright operating cost and to have the right model in terms of servicing the large customer base,\nwhich microfinance kind of services. So things have evolved, changed over time. Things like\ndigital collections have picked up. Even for Spandana, it is now trending at around 14%\ncompared to what used to be more like 3% to 4%. So things are evolving and that's why I think\n2.5%, 3% would be the new normal.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. And sir, if I can just squeeze in one last question for franchises like us, given that the\nAUM has run down, the opex continues to remain elevated, which are essentially fixed costs,\nthe employees that we have on board. So I'm just trying to understand till the time that AUM\nscales up, right, how are we thinking about opex in the near term, maybe the next couple of\nquarters? Is there an intent to kind of let's say, when people leave, right, there's normal attrition.\nSo we'll just let it be, right, and not replace them\nAshish Damani: You're right. Sorry to stop you there, but I get the question. How is that we are going to look at\nproductivity and overall employee cost to play out in the near future, if that's the question,\nAbhijit? So I think if you look at our last 3 quarters, we were at 19,808 as number of employees\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\nwent down to 18,382 in March, went down to 15,574 in June of '25. So we are focusing on\noperational efficiencies on the ground.\nWe have also merged about 81 branches, and we will look at more improvements on the footprint\nand align it with the rundown in the AUM that we have seen. So yes, operating cost is one of\nthe areas where the focus isand if there is an attrition, we will be very watchful in terms of\nreplacing or backfilling the employee base in only those geographies where there is a need to\nfrom a productivity metrics perspective.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashlesh Sonje from Kotak Securities.\nAshlesh Sonje: The first question is on Slide number 6 in your presentation, where you show lender overlap.\nOut of this 21%, which is exposed to Spandana plus 3 or more, how much of this would be\nalready delinquent in 0 plus?\nAshish Damani: Sorry, I don't have that number handy, but just to give you a similar data point, the Spandana\nplus 3 borrowers over a period of time have contributed about 30% in our GNPA in the past. So\nthey definitely are far more delinquent compared to the rest of the buckets. For this standing\n21%, we'll just come back to you.\nBut we have given another slide where it gives us an idea into what kind of percentage of\ncustomers are, delinquent across Spandana base. So 13% of the customers are over 30 when we\nlook at the Spandana book. And the rest of the customers who are, in Spandana plus 3, but are\nvery likely to be and continued to be in current bucket as far as our book is concerned, 96% of\nthe rest of the book is current with us.\nAshlesh Sonje: Understood, sir. And you in your opening remarks, you spoke about the cooling off period. Can\nyou shed more details on that?\nAshish Damani: So earlier, we used to give customer loan after 6 months of the first loan. Now we wait for 12\nmonths before we give the second loan.\nAshlesh Sonje: And what is the typical contracted maturity of that loan for you?\nAshish Damani: We have 85% of our loans are for 2 years and roughly 15% of the loans are for 12 and 18 months.\nAshlesh Sonje: This cooling off period refers to the period after which the borrower becomes eligible for a\nreplacement loan effectively.\nAshish Damani: That's correct.\nModerator: We have a last minute registration coming from the line of Mr. Abhijit Tibrewal from Motilal\nOswal.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Sir, if I can ask you just 2 more questions. First thing is, how is our Board thinking about\nsuccession now? Since the time Shalabh sir left, what is the progress that the Board has made in\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\ncase you can share some thoughts around it, , at least how are we approaching that? If there is\nanything at all that you can share?\nAshish Damani: Yes, sure. Abhijit, I think the Board has been looking at this particular thing in great detailand I\nthink they have initiated the process some time back. So in next 30 to 45 days, we should be able\nto get this concluded.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. And sir, , the inclination is to get someone external or are there also internal candidates\nin the fray.\nAshish Damani: No. So we have discussed this last quarter, and the Board will look at both internal as well as\nexternal candidates and look at what is the best for the enterprise too.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. And lastly, sir, if you could just refresh our memories with regards to Kedaara's holding.\nI remember they were invested from a fund. They were also invested in another housing finance\ncompany from that fund, which they have already exited now.So if you could just refresh all our\nmemories, how are they placed on that, that will be very useful for all of us.\nAshish Damani: So Kedaara holds about 48.12% and 41% comes from the fund -- the old fund, Fund I of Kedaara\nand the rest comes from Fund III. And that's where they stand. And they continue to hold that\npost the rights issue as well. So very much intact in terms of their holding.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Anand Kumar Ela, an investor.\nAnand Kumar Ela: The point I was trying to ask was in July, the disbursements at INR 268 crores. How are the first\n2 weeks in August, the disbursements picking up?\nAshish Damani: Anandji. Yes, the trend has been better than what we have seen in July for the first 2 weeks. I\nthink we are still not close to our BAU or potential. I think we will take one more month. And\nfrom September onwards, we should see a very normalized kind of disbursements.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Prabal Gandhi from InCred AMC.\nPrabal Gandhi: Sir, just one question. When we see the Slide number 6, there is a mention that asset quality of\nloans disbursed under Guardrail 1 has delinquency of 4.4%. So even after implementation of\nstricter norms for us, we are still seeing delinquencies as high as 4.4% so any comments there?\nAshish Damani: I think that was Guardrail 1, which has been given out there. And at that time, I'm not sure if the\nindustry was following all the norms. So there is a possibility that while we would have selected\nthe customer, the customer went into Spandana plus 3 or higher and subsequently, the\nperformance was not as good as what we see now. That's the long and short of it, Prabal.\nPrabal Gandhi: Sir, can you share any data points with respect to say, the new disbursements that we have done\nin the last 6 months, which indicates that the delinquencies there are either lower than the\nindustry or lower than what we have seen historically, something that you can share on that, sir.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nAugust 14, 2025\nAshish Damani: That's the information on that Slide 6, which you're referring to. If you see whatever we have\ndisbursed in this financial year, all the loans are stacking up at 100%. And last quarter, if you\nhave to look at, that's the other number where we have said Guardrail 1+.\nPrabal Gandhi: Okay. And secondly, when we see the percentage of 3-plus lenders, despite some INR 10 billion\nprovisions in last 2 quarters, that number is quite sticky for us at 21%-22%. So ideally that\nnumber should have come down since we have written off so aggressively. Why is that number\nnot coming down for us?\nAshish Damani: The underlying is number of borrowers that are standing on a date, since there are a lot of\ncustomers who have closed their loans with us and have become dormant doesn't form part of\ndenominator or numerator here. If I were to add that, then yes, this number, like you have rightly\nsaid, would have come down.\nPrabal Gandhi: Meaning we have closed the loans for good customers?\nAshish Damani: Yes. Customers have closed their loan by repaying all the amounts. However, subsequent loan\nwas not given to them at this point in time. They remain dormant with usAnd as and when we\nstart giving them loans or disburse to them, this number will start improving. Moreover, in\nfuture, we've just started new to credit customers with us and once we start adding these\ncustomers new to credit, the denominator and this 21% number will change accordingly.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Prasanjan Mitra from RCO.\nPrasanjan Mitra: Just one question from me. What are the ways that we are tracking the new portfolio? Basically,\njust to understand if there is a way that we are looking at the old and the new portfolio separately,\nlet's say, the last 3 or 6 months, whatever we have disbursed, are they tracking significantly\ndifferent metrics as compared to the old?\nAshish Damani: No. So the tracking part is same. I think the origination or the credit appraisal when we have\nmentioned, we had much stricter norms, which cuts across both the guardrail metrices as well as\nsome internal metrices on geography, on how the center behaves and some of the aspects which\ncome from the field. So all put together is how we have looked at the origination part was very\ndifferent from what we would have done in the past.\nPrasanjan Mitra: And from an asset quality metrics, are we tracking better kind of quality on the recent portfolio?\nI mean is there a way to determine if what we are doing is working?\nAshish Damani: That's right. So that Slide 6, which we just discussed with the earlier participant, if you please\nrefer to that, the loans which have been disbursed in, fourth quarter, were trending at 95.6%\ncurrent book. And if you have to look at what has been disbursed in this financial year, it is\ntrending at 100%.\nModerator: Ladies and gentlemen, as there are no further questions, I now hand the conference over to the\nmanagement for closing comments.\n",

Good evening, everyone. And thank you for taking time out to join on this\ncall. Our sincere apologies for the delay.\nI believe most of you have got some chance to go through the Q4, FY '25 results, and even the\nfull year Results, which have been uploaded on Stock Exchange sometime back.\nBefore discussing the results, I would like to clarify on three issues:\nFirst of all, just want to explain that every NBFC MFI will undergo routine audit by the RBI\nevery year. And in the process, they do suggest areas of improvement as their observations. As\nalways, we have been complying with all the suggestions made.\nThe company also conducts review through both internal as well as external experts, agencies\nfor continuous improvement in a routine course of business. So, that is something that we have\nbeen doing. I would like to reiterate that there has been no forensic audit on the company\nwhatsoever.\nMFI customers tend to make their repayments through cash only. Therefore, this industry is\nsusceptible to operational risk of misappropriation, theft, and robbery. Every prudent lender,\nincluding Spandana, has control mechanisms in place to control and manage such risks in the\nbusiness.\nHowever, in the recent past, the industry has seen higher stress and attrition, which has led to an\nincrease in such incidents across the industry. Spandana too faced these issues during the 2nd,\n3rd Quarter of the financial year. However, we are continuously working to reinforce control\nmechanisms through measures such as increased headcount on branch quality managers,\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nincreasing internal audit frequencies and coverage, etc. We have seen improvements in terms of\na reduction in the overall challenges in past couple of quarters.\nWhile Spandana adopted credit rules confirming to the Guardrail 2 and even going beyond in\nJanuary of 2025, the deferment of Guardrail 2 implementation by SRO to 1st of April 2025\nprompted us to rationalize our disbursements in Q4. During the period, the company was focused\non improving its collections and its processes by way of increasing engagement with the\ncustomers on the ground.\nNow I move on to one more important update:\nOur equity raise plans are pretty much on track. We have received shareholder approval for\ncapital raise during March for up to Rs. 750 crores. The Board Committee has been formed to\noversee this capital raise, including a possible rights issue in Q2 FY '26. This rights issue will\nbe done with the promoter participation. We will make all the necessary announcements in due\ncourse once all approvals are in place.\nLike we have been reiterating on the fact that FY ‘25 has been the most challenging period for\nthe microfinance industry in the recent times, multiple external and structural headwinds in\nincreasing borrower leverage, weakening of JLG model, deterioration in borrower discipline and\nsocio-political influences had adverse impact on the microfinance industry. Our short and long-\nterm response to this industry headwinds has been bucketed into three broad domains.\nOperations, credit underwriting, and liquidity and capital position.\nDuring the year, we remained agile and introduced a few changes in the way we operate. Among\nmany, let me highlight a few important ones. Introduction of control and quality check layer at\nthe branches which we call branch quality managers. The core function of this role is to be a\nchecker at the branches and ensure that all due processes and quality checks are diligently\nfollowed.\nWe have increased the number of loan officers during the year at the branches to manage the\nworkload as they had to make multiple rounds of borrowerhouse visits for collections. The\nincreased stress resulted in elevated attrition at the field level. And taking cognizance of these\nissues, we have increased the bench strength, which had impacted the efficiencies in the interim.\nWe have put in place a dedicated team of collections, loan officers for the buckets which are 90+\nDPD borrowers. This team is focused on following up with the borrowers in the 90+ and the\nwrite-off pools for recoveries. We currently have about 700 loan officers in this team, and we\nplan to intensify efforts in recovery during FY ‘26.\nIncreasing engagement with the field staff through various initiatives is something that we have\nbeen taking up so that the attrition levels can get controlled. Telecalling the borrowers to\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nencourage them to make timely payments. Explaining them about the new guardrails and\nencouraging them to follow the discipline of making timely payments.\nAs a team, we keep looking for means to make our processes more efficient and improving our\noperations. We have always maintained that as an organization we continue to believe in core\nmicrofinance that is short tenures, low ticket sizes and geographical diversification.\nSupplementing this, we introduced credit checks in January 2025 which go beyond guardrails.\nOur credit rules are more conservative as we have set a DPD threshold of 30 days for the existing\nborrowers and we have gone down to one day for any new borrower that we will onboard.\nIn addition, we are also checking the DPD status of the household to ensure that the household\nis not in any kind of financial stress. To increase the robustness of our KYC checks, we have\nentered into an agreement with NPCI for Aadhaar-based e-KYC.\nWith these initiatives in place, we believe that we can now restart the new to credit borrowers\ngradually. This is something that we have taken as a conscious call to stop onboarding the new\nto credit in July last year.\nTo manage our liabilities better in such testing times, we have been maintaining sufficient\nliquidity on the balance sheet. This liquidity provides sufficient headroom to be able to meet all\nshort and medium-term requirements. Our liquidity position at the end of March 2025 were over\nRs. 2,000 crores, which is about 24% of our assets on our balance sheet.\nSpandana had witnessed improvement in key lead indicators in March and our X-bucket\ncollection efficiency at the end of March 2025 improved to 98.9% if I exclude Karnataka out of\nit. Including Karnataka, it would be 98.6%,. And December was 98% when we looked at the\nsame metric.\nWe have been consistently seeing an improving trend in the lender overlap as well. About 23%\nof borrowers had exposure to four or more lenders, including Spandana, in February 2025, which\nhas now reduced to about 20%.\nSimilarly, intense field efforts have also translated into higher recoveries from the GNPA or 90+\nbuckets, including write-off pool, which stood at about Rs. 52 crores in 4th Quarter of FY '25\nversus Rs. 44 crores, which we would have recovered across the three quarters in the financial\nyear. Overall, we were able to recover Rs. 96 crores during FY '25.\nAs a Management Team, we had set ourselves a few priorities. While we made progress on all\nof these, the challenges in FY ‘25 have resulted in altered timelines.\nLet me enumerate our way forward on each of these priorities:\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nCustomer acquisition led growth:\nWe have always communicated that our growth will be fueled by customer acquisition, and we\nwill be very careful in terms of onboarding the new customers that we get. Our stricter credit\nrules are a step in that direction.\nWell distributed geography spread:\nI am sure you would have noticed that our geography exposures have been well distributed. We\nhave improved our geography spread over the past three years. North India now contributes\nabout 22% of the AUM as against 13% in FY ‘22. We continue to maintain our spread going\nforward.\nWeekly model:\nWe have rolled out many branches under the weekly only model over the last two years and\nthese branches today give us the X-bucket collection efficiencies of 99.3% in March compared\nto the overall 98.9% across the business. So, our belief in this weekly business is reinforced and\nwe will continue to see how we improve on the overall contribution from the weekly branches.\nGrowing our AUM:\nOur long-term goal of AUM growth remains intact, albeit with altered timelines. We will be\ncautious in lending and growing in new markets.\nImproving efficiencies:\nOur target in current financial year will be to improve borrowers to LO count to about 340\nborrowers from the current 228 number.\nWe are working very hard to turn around things at the earliest and deliver on a quality growth\nthat we desire for. To deliver on quality growth, we are reimagining our customer journeys by\nintegrating multiple layers of technology, enable checks and balances including using tools like\ngeofencing, face match, liveliness checks, digital questionnaires, etc. While some of these\ninitiatives have already been rolled out, many others will be integrated during the year. All these\nwe believe will help us improve our credit underwriting and filter in quality customers.\nWe have also been closely looking at our borrower base and identifying the borrowers that we\nwould like to prioritize in terms of servicing. Of our existing borrower base, at the end of March\n2025, about 51% of the borrowers qualify for new loan under the stricter credit rules that we\nhave adopted internally. About 20% of the borrowers have 30+ DPD with some other lenders,\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\n10% have three or more lender relationships, and about 4% have over Rs. 2 lakh loan amount\noutstanding in the MFI or unsecured retail or some other form of negative CB track record.\nHowever, 96% of these borrowers, which is all the put together 34%, are current with Spandana.\nWe believe that these two cohorts, 51% and 34%, together would provide us with a sufficiently\nlarge pool of customers to focus our efforts during the course of the year.\nWe also have a large pool of dormant borrowers who qualify for loans as per our internal\nguidelines and we would reach out to these borrowers as well. We will run regular analytics on\nour borrower data to identify early warnings while also look for opportunities to deepen our\nrelationship with good borrowers without compromising on quality.\nAs I mentioned some while back, we have been working on improving efficiencies which we\nhave touched upon on our presentation in Slide #13. Based on our portfolio behavior, we have\nidentified a set of states where we would like to grow but cautiously.\nWe have also identified key states where we would maintain our position and a few states where\nwe would prefer to scale back operations. We would conduct graded reassessments of our\nbranches in terms of portfolio quality and growth opportunities. We would like to increase\nproductivity and efficiencies at branches and expect to improve our loan officer productivity to\nabout Rs. 1.1 crores per loan officer by end of FY ‘26 from the current Rs. 0.6 crores at end of\nFY ‘25. We continue to believe that loan officer productivity of about Rs. 1.3 crores to Rs. 1.5\ncrores is pretty appropriate.\nLet me now just move to the results and business updates:\nThe key business drivers:\nDuring the year, the company adopted a cautious approach to lending and implemented\nguardrails into our credit rule engine. Hence, our disbursements were calibrated for the year and\nwere muted at Rs. 5,605 crores on a year-on-year basis, a decline of about 48%.\nAUM at the end of the year was at Rs. 6,819 crores, registering a decline of 43% year-on-year.\nThe AUM was the outcome of lower disbursement. However, we are confident that we will be\nable to take it back in the direction of growth during the current financial year.\nOur LAP and Nano loans business under the subsidiary Criss Financial Limited is growing\nsteadily. The AUM under these products crossed Rs. 200 crores for the first time. And we closed\nthe financial year with Rs. 233 crores AUM under these product lines. The product quality under\nboth these products continues to be strong with the net collection efficiency of 99.6% under the\nLAP for March 2025. We continue to believe in this strong market and potential for these\nproducts.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nPortfolio quality:\nWe continue to maintain provisioning at 80% PCR. The standalone GNPA at the end of FY ‘25\nwas 4.85%, an increase of 3.4% over FY 24. Standalone NNPA was at 0.96%, an increase of\n0.7% over FY ‘24.\nLiability and marginal cost of borrowings, including borrowing mix:\nDuring the year, we borrowed Rs. 4,482 crores. The borrowings were calibrated, keeping in view\nthe disbursement and the organization's liquidity requirements. Our marginal cost of borrowings\nfor the quarter was at 11.9%, which was about 20 bps higher than Q4 of FY ’24 and about 20\nbps higher than Q3 FY ‘25. Likewise, I look at the borrowing mix. We now have more healthy\nmix with banks contributing to our total borrowings at 57% at the end of Q4 FY ‘25.\nFY ‘25 Financial Performance:\nThe net interest income for the year was at Rs. 1,228 crores over Rs. 1,289 crores reported for\nFY ‘24. NII was lowered by 5%. PPOP for the year was at Rs. 608 crores, down 35% year-on-\nyear. Declining PPOP was largely on account of shrinking loan book, higher operating expenses\nand reversals on interest income due to flows in GNPA.\nYield on the portfolio was down by 1.7% year-on-year to 22.5%. Yield declined by 41 bps over\nthe previous quarter. NIM for the year was at 12.8%, down by 1.3% year-on-year. NIM declined\nas a result of decline in the yield and increase in marginal cost of borrowings. We are consistently\nworking towards improving our cost of borrowings.\nThe company reported a net loss of Rs. 1,035 crores for the year on account of higher provisions.\nGiven the challenges, we will continue to maintain cautious stand. We are optimistic that the\nsituation should normalize by the second quarter of this financial year. All our efforts are directed\ntowards identifying opportunities for improvements and implement corrective steps where\nnecessary. We are also closely monitoring outcomes thereof.\nWe continue to be prudent in our approach to lending ensuring that our portfolio is well\ndiversified while staying conservative on ticket sizes and customer indebtedness. We are\ncomfortably placed in terms of capital adequacy at 37% and close to Rs. 2,000 crores in liquidity.\nOur gearing at 2.1x is also accommodative of future growth.\nDespite the rapid global policy shifts, India remains a largely positive growth story. The early\narrival of monsoon and expectations of above normal monsoon bodes well for the microfinance\nindustry where most of our borrowers are placed in rural India and are dependent on agriculture\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nas a primary source of income. This we believe will be a factor that will drive the revival of the\nsector along with the SRO guardrails that have been put in place.\nThank you once again for taking time out to join us on this call. The entire management team of\nSpandana is thankful for the consistent feedback that we have been receiving from all of you.\nWe look forward to your continued support. And now I can ask the moderator to open the floor\nfor questions.\nModerator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question\ncomes from the line of Mahrukh Adajania from Nuvama Wealth. Please go ahead.\nMahrukh Adajania: Good evening. So, I have a couple of questions. Firstly, on Slide #17, you have given some\nprojections for FY ‘26. And it seems to be reverting back to FY ’24, whereas FY '25 is a big\nblip. So, how do you plan to cover so much ground? What gives you confidence? Especially\nbecause most MFIs are saying that a better part of the recovery including growth will come in\nthe second half. So, what gives you that confidence of covering so much ground? That's my first\nquestion.\nAnd secondly, just in terms of credit cost, forward flows and slippages, you have given some\ndata till April. How does early May look like? And where do you think will you see a meaningful\nor when do you think you will see a meaningful decline in credit cost and some rollbacks as\nwell? So, that's my second question.\nAnd my third question is any size of the equity issue? So, these are my questions.\nAshish Damani: Hi, Mahrukh. This is Ashish. So, I believe you are talking about Slide #12, where we have given\nthe disbursement trends which we had in FY '23 and '24. Is that correct?\nMahrukh Adajania: I am talking about the projection, right? You have given projections and in terms of loans for\nLO, disburses for LO, you have given projections for March 26. That is what I am talking about.\nAshish Damani: Okay, so these projections are for productivity matrices at a loan officer level, which will be a\ncombination of increasing the customer base, doing the disbursements, as well as there is\nattrition that is likely to happen in the branches wherever we would have taken higher number\nof loan officers. So, the idea is to keep looking at that productivity of 340 by the end of this\nfinancial year in terms of the number of customers per loan officer. So, I am not sure if that has\nanswered your question, but that is what we are trying to explain here on this slide.\nIf I can move to your second question in terms of how the current trends are shaping up, how is\nMay looking like and when there will be a meaningful decline? So, yes, March was pretty solid\nat 99% in terms of collection efficiency. However, April and May there has been a slight blip.\nWe are presently trending at about 97% and thereabouts on the current bucket or X bucket.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nLast question was about the size of the transaction. I think we have taken approval from the\nshareholders at about Rs. 750 crores. However, we are looking at presently doing maybe a rights\nissue of, it will obviously be a lower number, but we will have to calibrate the number in due\ncourse.\nMahrukh Adajania: I will come back for more later.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Shreepal Doshi from Equirus. Please go ahead.\nShreepal Doshi: Hi, sir. Thanks for giving me the opportunity. And I think your earlier commentary was very\neasy to understand a lot of aspects, but just had a question on our business model per se. So, are\nwe looking to say, decouple the sourcing and the let’s say, operations and the credit at the ground\nlevel which would also be learning in this cycle per se? Or are we continuing to just go ahead\nwith weekly as a model and continue to have the LO or the loan officer managing both the\nfunctions at the ground level?\nAshish Damani: No, so, weekly, we will continue in the branches where we have the weekly model. We have\nabout 14% of our business in weekly branches. And we would obviously grow that portfolio\ngiven the portfolio quality is definitely better than what we see in monthly branches. On the\nmonthly branches side, I don't think so we are making any changes. It's only about increasing\nthe engagement with the customers by the loan officers.\nShreepal Doshi: So, are we looking at, let's say, having a credit officer at branch level who will look at, let's say,\nunderwriting and we are shifting towards a model which wherein we will be underwriting\nindividual customers while maintaining the JLG model from the operations point of view?\nAshish Damani: Definitely there will have to be a little bit more credit appraisal that needs to be done at a\nborrower level over and above the joint liability that you have on the ground. We are having a\nbranch quality manager, like I have said earlier, at the branches, who is doing further checks in\nterms of understanding the borrowers which are getting onboarded. We have used like I have\nmentioned earlier, we are using technology to improve our understanding of the borrower at the\nground by doing geofencing, by doing liveliness check, making sure that the KYC that we are\ngetting is more robust and more foolproof. This is what we are doing in terms of additional\nchecks.\nShreepal Doshi: The second question was pertaining to something that you also alluded in our earlier\ncommentary, which was on Aadhaar-based, linking Aadhaar of the customer for the new\ncustomer onboarding. So, I think there was a lot of duplication of accounts at system level. And\nso, have we got approval from the RBI to use Aadhaar as a medium to onboard the customer and\nto do even credit bureau check accordingly?\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nAshish Damani: So, Shreepal, we are presently following this e-KYC process where e-sign is the format that we\nuse, where Aadhaar becomes the aspect that you use through OTP-based verification. So, we\nstill don't have the license in terms of AUA or KUA. What we are using is the next stage we will\nmove to is, we are working with the NPCI and others for the e-Setu piece, where we will be able\nto do this much more smoothly. It will be Aadhaar-based customer identification where other\nthan the OTP, there will also be a face recognition that we will use.\nShreepal Doshi: Thank you so much for answering my questions. I will come in the queue for more questions.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Viral Shah from IIFL Capital. Please go ahead.\nViral Shah: Hi, Ashish. Two questions. One is you mentioned that the current X-bucket collection efficiency\ntrends are trending closer to 97%. This is excluding Karnataka or this is at an overall level basis.\nAshish Damani: This is overall. If you exclude Karnataka, it would be about 97.8.\nViral Shah: And another question I have is, see the deferred tax asset that we have recognized in this year,\nnow also this quarter, do you think that is an aggressive estimate given if you look at another\npeer of yours, who has also suffered a couple of quarters of losses, heavy losses, they have\nchosen not to, say, recognize that as a deferred tax asset at least as of now until there is a visibility\nor one delivers profits? Do you think that was an aggressive, I would say, practice that you took\nin this quarter?\nAshish Damani: Viral, I can talk for ourselves. I think what we look at in the deferred tax recognition is how our\nbusiness plan will shape up in the next 5 years. In fact, the authorities allow you to look at the\nnext 8 years and we were sufficiently covered.\nViral Shah: That's it from my side. Thank you, Ashish.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Rajiv Mehta from YES Securities. Please go ahead.\nRajiv Mehta: Hi, Ashish. Just on this borrowing side, this fund raised in the quarter of Rs. 473 crore, can you\ntell us from which sources was this raised? And what percentage of lenders or bank loans will\nbe under covenant breaches and how does the covenant breaches go away? And besides capital,\ncan there be profitability constraints or high liquidity constraints for funding the growth that we\nare planning to have?\nAshish Damani: Sorry, Rajiv, your last question, can you repeat?\nRajiv Mehta: Sir, I am talking about covenant breaches, if you are having any, for the borrowing that we have.\nAnd when does it go away? And whether, you know, besides the capital that we are planning to\nraise, can profitability also act as a constraint for the covenants to remain in place?\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nAshish Damani: Sure. So, the covenant breaches, yes, there have been certain covenant breaches due to both the\nportfolio quality numbers as well as profitability. The number stacks up presently at Rs. 438\ncrores in total where Rs. 260 crores is from the capital markets and about Rs. 178 crores from\nthe term lending side. I see this number start going down in near future. We have got the\nnecessary waivers and comfort from the lenders. They continue to support us. And we don’t see\nthis acting as any kind of a constraint on future growth plans.\nRajiv Mehta: Just on this disbursement activity being low at this point in time and now when you also follow\nthe guardrails of your own self which are tighter than the industry, and then you also given us\nthe cut of your customer base and that 51% of the borrower base currently only eligible for\nincremental disbursements as per the current rules that you are following, when does it really\nchange, the runway change for us?\nBecause I think if you are trying to tell us that like a normal year, the first half will be slightly\ndecreased and second half you can pick up. But when you look at the eligible customer pool,\ncurrently at the start of the year, that seems low. So, how would, I mean, if you can just quantify,\nI mean, would there be any way you can quantify what kind of growth or how do you see the\nyear playing out for yourself in terms of the book by the end of the year?\nAshish Damani: So, I think the industry is slated to grow, let's say, between 10% to 15% with the kind of customer\nbase we have and the numbers that we have kind of put up on the slide, both in terms of existing\nborrowers and the number of borrowers that we would want to bring on board. I think we can\nlook at about 20% kind of the growth from the current base. That's the number that will work\nout.\nRajiv Mehta: Yes, that's it.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashlesh Sonje from Kotak Securities. Please go ahead.\nAshlesh Sonje: Hey, hi, Ashish . Good evening. Sir, the first question is on the employee base. Firstly, do you\nthink you are adequately staffed right now? And secondly, you indicated a few employee-related\nissues in the beginning. Can you broadly quantify what is the amount of money which is\ncurrently outstanding from your employees? Or any magnitude which you can share of the\nemployee related issue?\nAshish Damani: Hi, Ashlesh. So, there is nothing outstanding from the employees or anything which has not been\ndisclosed, or which has not been accounted for. Yes, there have been attritions ,. I mean the\npercentage terms, it was very high for the previous financial year, 56%. And what we have done\nis we have let go, , we have not back filled some of the geographies wherever the borrower to\nloan officer count was much lower than the national average to let it adjust on a normal course,\nthe productivity matrices. And that is something that we will continue to do as we go forward.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nAshlesh Sonje: And in terms of geographies, where do you see higher collection efficiencies and lower\ncollection efficiencies?\nAshish Damani: So, our challenging markets in the recent times have been Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka have been\nthe challenging geographies for us. The rest of the states, while April was a bit lower, May,\nthings are picking up and we are confident that June will be even better, given the monsoon\nsetting in.\nAshlesh Sonje: And just one last clarification. If I go to Slide # 9 on your PPT where you have shared the lender\nlevel overlap, this is as a proportion of borrowers or as a proportion of the loan book?\nAshish Damani: This is at borrower level. But I think in our case, given that the average ticket sizes and average\nloan amount outstanding is relatively uniform, I think both should be more or less in line.\nAshlesh Sonje: Those are all the questions I had.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Abhishek M from HSBC. Please go ahead.\nAshish Damani: Hi, Abhishek.\nAbhishek M: Hi, Ashish. So, this 20% growth target you saying, that is at AUM or disbursements, which one,\nAUM I am guessing, right?\nAshish Damani: That's right, Abhishek.\nAbhishek M: So, on an absolute level, how much disbursements will be your plan for this year?\nAshish Damani: I think the disbursement number will also be in line with roughly about the AUM size only.\nGiven that most of the disbursement happened towards the second half of the financial year,\nwhich is what we have tried to explain in the PPT on Slide #12, so, more or less, equal amount\nof disbursement is what we will have to do.\nAbhishek M: Wouldn't it have to be higher given you are defocusing on some states? There are obviously a\nlot of customers who are ineligible to be given a repeat loan. So, considering all of that, don't\nyou think disbursements has to go much higher than just 20%?\nAshish Damani: No, I think we have done our math. And what we need to do is get that 53% of the existing\nborrowers to be serviced from the overall bucket. And obviously, there will be new customer\nonboarding that we are starting. So, there will be disbursements from there as well.\nAbhishek M: And in terms of productivity, with 340 per loan officer, is this a sort of new normal which you\nare targeting? Because even '24 you were there and when things went south, you had to increase\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\na lot of people to ease the pressure of collection. Again, don't you think you have to keep slight\nexcess capacity to prepare for a rainy day or do you think 340 builds in it enough excess capacity\nthat can be handled if something goes wrong in any state or any local area?\nAshish Damani: So, FY ‘25 was a relatively challenging year and one would not call it as a BAU in any stretch\nof imagination. I think with the guardrails which have been put in place, we strongly believe that\nthe discipline in the borrowers will improve from here on. And that will definitely ease out the\nchallenges which are being faced by the loan officers on the ground. The fact that the borrower\nis not going to get a fresh loan if they are not paying to all the lenders will definitely help. And\nwith that easing of pressure, I think we should be able to improve on this borrower to loan count\nnumber as we go on.\nMoreover, the tightening on the credit rule that we have done also gives us the confidence that\nthe book that we will build from here on should relatively be easier for the loan officers to\nmanage. So, that number also should help us improve the productivity. And we are also\ntransforming the center penetration. That should also help the loan officers to improve the\nproductivity.\nAbhishek M: And how are you thinking about yields from here? Would you be in any position, I think, one of\nthe banks who does MFI, they took a little bit of an increase in yield. But would you be in a\nposition to increase yields or this is BAU and from here, whatever NIM benefit has to come, has\nto come from basically cost of funds?\nAshish Damani: I think our pricing to the borrowers is pretty fine. The challenge has been primarily on account\nof the quality which has led to reverses on the interest income and impact on the top line. So, I\ndon't see a need or a reason right now to look at the pricing at the borrower level.\nModerator: Your next question comes from the line of Patanjali from Nuvama Crossover Fund. Please go\nahead.\nPatanjali: So, one question. I understand the situation is difficult, but just want to understand when can we\nsee some kind of profitability, in which quarter, say, Q3, Q4? And any kind of guidance that you\ncan give for FY '26? I understand it is difficult, but still.\nAshish Damani: So, I think you are pretty correct when you say that it is a difficult one. I think the right way to\nlook at it is our focus would be to improve on the discipline on the ground, improve on the X-\nbuckets are trending fine. We have to just make sure that it starts stacking up above 99%. And\nas we start improving in terms of our credit rule and making the new portfolio at a better\nefficiency, then I think 99% should be pretty straightforward. And that should help the\nprofitability as we go forward. Giving any number or any guidance at this point in time will be\ngetting ahead of ourselves. So, probably, I think the right way to look at it is, by end of this\nfinancial year, I think the 3rd Quarter onwards, things should start looking up much better.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Abhijit Tibrewal from Motilal Oswal. Please go ahead.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Good evening, Ashish sir. Thank you for taking my questions. Sir, first thing, just trying to\nunderstand, you spoke about the rights issue, planning to do it in Q2. I mean, if you could just\nsort of understand from what we know until now, Kedaara, which is a promoter, they have\nalready taken a one-year extension. And they have to now exit by September 2026. So, does that\nstill hold or under such extraordinary circumstances, we can get a further extension from that\nfund? And B, when we say the promoter is looking to participate in the rights issue, I mean, even\nif there are rights which are denounced by the existing shareholders or the team to pick that up.\nAshish Damani: So, what we presently understand is, you know, they have confirmed their participation. The\ndenouncing and picking up of the other shareholders is something that we will have to look at it\nwhen we get closer to the transaction.\nIn terms of their existing fund and in terms of this, what I understand is they do have time for\n1.5 years from now. And what I understand is that they don't have pressure to do any action on\nthat holding of theirs as of now. And the extension part is something that I believe can be done\nif need be.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: But at least when we say that the promoters are looking to participate, Kedaara is looking to\nparticipate in the rights? issue.\nAshish Damani: Yes.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Ashish, the thing that I wanted to understand is, I mean, you will recall recently when Bharat\nFinancial also reported a lot of discrepancies which were identified in terms of processes,\naccounting, reporting, given that you spoke about the regular audits which are done by RBI in\nthe normal course, have we until now identified anything like that in terms of maybe accounting\nlapses or some reporting lapses between what needs to be classified under interest income or\nwhat needs to be classified under fee income, anything of that sort?\nAshish Damani: No, RBI has not identified anything of that sort. Yes, there has been a discussion with the\nregulator on how we look at the ARC transactions that we have done, but nothing other than\nthat.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: And then lastly, I mean, you kind of spelt out that we will be looking at 20% kind of AUM\ngrowth this year. There are other questions already that people were trying to ask you, when can\nwe get to profitability? Difficult indeed.\nBut, sir, when we speak to MFI industry experts today, all of them say that roughly anywhere\naround 20% to 22% kind of loan losses should be there at the industry level because of whatever\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nwe went through in the last one year. Last year, our credit costs were roughly around 23%-24%\non the average AUM.\nJust trying to understand from here to next year now, what could transpire into credit costs? One\nis the current GNPA pool that we have. The other thing could be the flows that we are seeing,\nwhich is where we are reporting X-bucket collection efficiencies of around 98.9% thereabouts.\nAnd in addition to that, some BAU credit costs, which are there in the normal course of business.\nSo, how should we look at credit costs then in FY '26?\nAshish Damani: I think on the credit cost bit, the right way to look at it is when do you get into BAU. And that,\nin my mind, should be Q3 or Q4 of this financial year. That is when probably we should start\nseeing the stabilization of the quality in the book. There are some, I am sure you would have\nlooked at our numbers and we do have the Stage 2 bucket which is there. And there would\nobviously be some flows from there. So, the percentages in the first half may be elevated in\nterms of the credit cost. However, in the second half of the financial year, we are positive that\nthese numbers would start normalizing.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: And just one related question, the last question. At least in terms of, I mean, while total\ndisbursements are very low, but at least in terms of the disbursements that we have done in the\nlast maybe six months, there is the portfolio quality holding up well, very low delinquencies or\nI mean, we continue to see flows from the newer disbursements as well, the ones done in the last\nsix months?\nAshish Damani: So, I would say in the last six months again there will be two pieces to it. The guardrails\nimplementation and the free regime so to say. So, it may not be exact comparable kind of a thing.\nHaving said that, I think, the last quarter's disbursement definitely was showing us better\nportfolio quality compared to what we have seen through the year.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: And sir, lastly, I mean, when Shalabh sir resigned and we hosted a call, there were obviously\nquestions around what is the way forward. Any discussions in the Board meeting today on how\nwe are kind of looking to put together the leadership team again?\nAshish Damani: So, if the question is about the leadership team, yes, it was unfortunate to see Shalabh going, but\nthe rest of the team is intact. However, on the CEO bit, I think the Board will do what is in the\nbest interest of the organization and they will definitely follow an approach which is\ncomprehensive, probably evaluating both internal and external candidates to see who fits the\nneed. And idea is to identify a leader who will best align with the long-term strategic priorities\nof the organization.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Thank you so much for patiently answering all my questions. I wish you and your team the very\nbest.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nModerator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, as there are no further questions from the participants, I now\nhand the conference over to Mr. Ashish Damani for closing comments.\nAshish Damani: Thank you once again for joining us, although it's very late. Thank you for all the support. We\nexpect you to continue to give us all the feedback. And if there are questions, we will be available\nsubsequently for you to reach out. Thank you very much.

            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nModerator: Ladies and gentlemen, good evening and welcome to Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited Q4\nand FY '25 Earnings Conference Call.\nThis Conference Call may contain certain forward-looking statements about the company which\nare based on the beliefs, opinions, and expectations of the company as on the date of this call.\nThese statements are not the guarantees of future performance and involve risks and\nuncertainties that are difficult to predict.\nAs a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode, and there will be an\nopportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes.

Good evening, everyone. And thank you for taking time out to join on this\ncall. Our sincere apologies for the delay.\nI believe most of you have got some chance to go through the Q4, FY '25 results, and even the\nfull year Results, which have been uploaded on Stock Exchange sometime back.\nBefore discussing the results, I would like to clarify on three issues:\nFirst of all, just want to explain that every NBFC MFI will undergo routine audit by the RBI\nevery year. And in the process, they do suggest areas of improvement as their observations. As\nalways, we have been complying with all the suggestions made.\nThe company also conducts review through both internal as well as external experts, agencies\nfor continuous improvement in a routine course of business. So, that is something that we have\nbeen doing. I would like to reiterate that there has been no forensic audit on the company\nwhatsoever.\nMFI customers tend to make their repayments through cash only. Therefore, this industry is\nsusceptible to operational risk of misappropriation, theft, and robbery. Every prudent lender,\nincluding Spandana, has control mechanisms in place to control and manage such risks in the\nbusiness.\nHowever, in the recent past, the industry has seen higher stress and attrition, which has led to an\nincrease in such incidents across the industry. Spandana too faced these issues during the 2nd,\n3rd Quarter of the financial year. However, we are continuously working to reinforce control\nmechanisms through measures such as increased headcount on branch quality managers,\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nincreasing internal audit frequencies and coverage, etc. We have seen improvements in terms of\na reduction in the overall challenges in past couple of quarters.\nWhile Spandana adopted credit rules confirming to the Guardrail 2 and even going beyond in\nJanuary of 2025, the deferment of Guardrail 2 implementation by SRO to 1st of April 2025\nprompted us to rationalize our disbursements in Q4. During the period, the company was focused\non improving its collections and its processes by way of increasing engagement with the\ncustomers on the ground.\nNow I move on to one more important update:\nOur equity raise plans are pretty much on track. We have received shareholder approval for\ncapital raise during March for up to Rs. 750 crores. The Board Committee has been formed to\noversee this capital raise, including a possible rights issue in Q2 FY '26. This rights issue will\nbe done with the promoter participation. We will make all the necessary announcements in due\ncourse once all approvals are in place.\nLike we have been reiterating on the fact that FY ‘25 has been the most challenging period for\nthe microfinance industry in the recent times, multiple external and structural headwinds in\nincreasing borrower leverage, weakening of JLG model, deterioration in borrower discipline and\nsocio-political influences had adverse impact on the microfinance industry. Our short and long-\nterm response to this industry headwinds has been bucketed into three broad domains.\nOperations, credit underwriting, and liquidity and capital position.\nDuring the year, we remained agile and introduced a few changes in the way we operate. Among\nmany, let me highlight a few important ones. Introduction of control and quality check layer at\nthe branches which we call branch quality managers. The core function of this role is to be a\nchecker at the branches and ensure that all due processes and quality checks are diligently\nfollowed.\nWe have increased the number of loan officers during the year at the branches to manage the\nworkload as they had to make multiple rounds of borrowerhouse visits for collections. The\nincreased stress resulted in elevated attrition at the field level. And taking cognizance of these\nissues, we have increased the bench strength, which had impacted the efficiencies in the interim.\nWe have put in place a dedicated team of collections, loan officers for the buckets which are 90+\nDPD borrowers. This team is focused on following up with the borrowers in the 90+ and the\nwrite-off pools for recoveries. We currently have about 700 loan officers in this team, and we\nplan to intensify efforts in recovery during FY ‘26.\nIncreasing engagement with the field staff through various initiatives is something that we have\nbeen taking up so that the attrition levels can get controlled. Telecalling the borrowers to\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nencourage them to make timely payments. Explaining them about the new guardrails and\nencouraging them to follow the discipline of making timely payments.\nAs a team, we keep looking for means to make our processes more efficient and improving our\noperations. We have always maintained that as an organization we continue to believe in core\nmicrofinance that is short tenures, low ticket sizes and geographical diversification.\nSupplementing this, we introduced credit checks in January 2025 which go beyond guardrails.\nOur credit rules are more conservative as we have set a DPD threshold of 30 days for the existing\nborrowers and we have gone down to one day for any new borrower that we will onboard.\nIn addition, we are also checking the DPD status of the household to ensure that the household\nis not in any kind of financial stress. To increase the robustness of our KYC checks, we have\nentered into an agreement with NPCI for Aadhaar-based e-KYC.\nWith these initiatives in place, we believe that we can now restart the new to credit borrowers\ngradually. This is something that we have taken as a conscious call to stop onboarding the new\nto credit in July last year.\nTo manage our liabilities better in such testing times, we have been maintaining sufficient\nliquidity on the balance sheet. This liquidity provides sufficient headroom to be able to meet all\nshort and medium-term requirements. Our liquidity position at the end of March 2025 were over\nRs. 2,000 crores, which is about 24% of our assets on our balance sheet.\nSpandana had witnessed improvement in key lead indicators in March and our X-bucket\ncollection efficiency at the end of March 2025 improved to 98.9% if I exclude Karnataka out of\nit. Including Karnataka, it would be 98.6%,. And December was 98% when we looked at the\nsame metric.\nWe have been consistently seeing an improving trend in the lender overlap as well. About 23%\nof borrowers had exposure to four or more lenders, including Spandana, in February 2025, which\nhas now reduced to about 20%.\nSimilarly, intense field efforts have also translated into higher recoveries from the GNPA or 90+\nbuckets, including write-off pool, which stood at about Rs. 52 crores in 4th Quarter of FY '25\nversus Rs. 44 crores, which we would have recovered across the three quarters in the financial\nyear. Overall, we were able to recover Rs. 96 crores during FY '25.\nAs a Management Team, we had set ourselves a few priorities. While we made progress on all\nof these, the challenges in FY ‘25 have resulted in altered timelines.\nLet me enumerate our way forward on each of these priorities:\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nCustomer acquisition led growth:\nWe have always communicated that our growth will be fueled by customer acquisition, and we\nwill be very careful in terms of onboarding the new customers that we get. Our stricter credit\nrules are a step in that direction.\nWell distributed geography spread:\nI am sure you would have noticed that our geography exposures have been well distributed. We\nhave improved our geography spread over the past three years. North India now contributes\nabout 22% of the AUM as against 13% in FY ‘22. We continue to maintain our spread going\nforward.\nWeekly model:\nWe have rolled out many branches under the weekly only model over the last two years and\nthese branches today give us the X-bucket collection efficiencies of 99.3% in March compared\nto the overall 98.9% across the business. So, our belief in this weekly business is reinforced and\nwe will continue to see how we improve on the overall contribution from the weekly branches.\nGrowing our AUM:\nOur long-term goal of AUM growth remains intact, albeit with altered timelines. We will be\ncautious in lending and growing in new markets.\nImproving efficiencies:\nOur target in current financial year will be to improve borrowers to LO count to about 340\nborrowers from the current 228 number.\nWe are working very hard to turn around things at the earliest and deliver on a quality growth\nthat we desire for. To deliver on quality growth, we are reimagining our customer journeys by\nintegrating multiple layers of technology, enable checks and balances including using tools like\ngeofencing, face match, liveliness checks, digital questionnaires, etc. While some of these\ninitiatives have already been rolled out, many others will be integrated during the year. All these\nwe believe will help us improve our credit underwriting and filter in quality customers.\nWe have also been closely looking at our borrower base and identifying the borrowers that we\nwould like to prioritize in terms of servicing. Of our existing borrower base, at the end of March\n2025, about 51% of the borrowers qualify for new loan under the stricter credit rules that we\nhave adopted internally. About 20% of the borrowers have 30+ DPD with some other lenders,\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\n10% have three or more lender relationships, and about 4% have over Rs. 2 lakh loan amount\noutstanding in the MFI or unsecured retail or some other form of negative CB track record.\nHowever, 96% of these borrowers, which is all the put together 34%, are current with Spandana.\nWe believe that these two cohorts, 51% and 34%, together would provide us with a sufficiently\nlarge pool of customers to focus our efforts during the course of the year.\nWe also have a large pool of dormant borrowers who qualify for loans as per our internal\nguidelines and we would reach out to these borrowers as well. We will run regular analytics on\nour borrower data to identify early warnings while also look for opportunities to deepen our\nrelationship with good borrowers without compromising on quality.\nAs I mentioned some while back, we have been working on improving efficiencies which we\nhave touched upon on our presentation in Slide #13. Based on our portfolio behavior, we have\nidentified a set of states where we would like to grow but cautiously.\nWe have also identified key states where we would maintain our position and a few states where\nwe would prefer to scale back operations. We would conduct graded reassessments of our\nbranches in terms of portfolio quality and growth opportunities. We would like to increase\nproductivity and efficiencies at branches and expect to improve our loan officer productivity to\nabout Rs. 1.1 crores per loan officer by end of FY ‘26 from the current Rs. 0.6 crores at end of\nFY ‘25. We continue to believe that loan officer productivity of about Rs. 1.3 crores to Rs. 1.5\ncrores is pretty appropriate.\nLet me now just move to the results and business updates:\nThe key business drivers:\nDuring the year, the company adopted a cautious approach to lending and implemented\nguardrails into our credit rule engine. Hence, our disbursements were calibrated for the year and\nwere muted at Rs. 5,605 crores on a year-on-year basis, a decline of about 48%.\nAUM at the end of the year was at Rs. 6,819 crores, registering a decline of 43% year-on-year.\nThe AUM was the outcome of lower disbursement. However, we are confident that we will be\nable to take it back in the direction of growth during the current financial year.\nOur LAP and Nano loans business under the subsidiary Criss Financial Limited is growing\nsteadily. The AUM under these products crossed Rs. 200 crores for the first time. And we closed\nthe financial year with Rs. 233 crores AUM under these product lines. The product quality under\nboth these products continues to be strong with the net collection efficiency of 99.6% under the\nLAP for March 2025. We continue to believe in this strong market and potential for these\nproducts.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nPortfolio quality:\nWe continue to maintain provisioning at 80% PCR. The standalone GNPA at the end of FY ‘25\nwas 4.85%, an increase of 3.4% over FY 24. Standalone NNPA was at 0.96%, an increase of\n0.7% over FY ‘24.\nLiability and marginal cost of borrowings, including borrowing mix:\nDuring the year, we borrowed Rs. 4,482 crores. The borrowings were calibrated, keeping in view\nthe disbursement and the organization's liquidity requirements. Our marginal cost of borrowings\nfor the quarter was at 11.9%, which was about 20 bps higher than Q4 of FY ’24 and about 20\nbps higher than Q3 FY ‘25. Likewise, I look at the borrowing mix. We now have more healthy\nmix with banks contributing to our total borrowings at 57% at the end of Q4 FY ‘25.\nFY ‘25 Financial Performance:\nThe net interest income for the year was at Rs. 1,228 crores over Rs. 1,289 crores reported for\nFY ‘24. NII was lowered by 5%. PPOP for the year was at Rs. 608 crores, down 35% year-on-\nyear. Declining PPOP was largely on account of shrinking loan book, higher operating expenses\nand reversals on interest income due to flows in GNPA.\nYield on the portfolio was down by 1.7% year-on-year to 22.5%. Yield declined by 41 bps over\nthe previous quarter. NIM for the year was at 12.8%, down by 1.3% year-on-year. NIM declined\nas a result of decline in the yield and increase in marginal cost of borrowings. We are consistently\nworking towards improving our cost of borrowings.\nThe company reported a net loss of Rs. 1,035 crores for the year on account of higher provisions.\nGiven the challenges, we will continue to maintain cautious stand. We are optimistic that the\nsituation should normalize by the second quarter of this financial year. All our efforts are directed\ntowards identifying opportunities for improvements and implement corrective steps where\nnecessary. We are also closely monitoring outcomes thereof.\nWe continue to be prudent in our approach to lending ensuring that our portfolio is well\ndiversified while staying conservative on ticket sizes and customer indebtedness. We are\ncomfortably placed in terms of capital adequacy at 37% and close to Rs. 2,000 crores in liquidity.\nOur gearing at 2.1x is also accommodative of future growth.\nDespite the rapid global policy shifts, India remains a largely positive growth story. The early\narrival of monsoon and expectations of above normal monsoon bodes well for the microfinance\nindustry where most of our borrowers are placed in rural India and are dependent on agriculture\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nas a primary source of income. This we believe will be a factor that will drive the revival of the\nsector along with the SRO guardrails that have been put in place.\nThank you once again for taking time out to join us on this call. The entire management team of\nSpandana is thankful for the consistent feedback that we have been receiving from all of you.\nWe look forward to your continued support. And now I can ask the moderator to open the floor\nfor questions.\nModerator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question\ncomes from the line of Mahrukh Adajania from Nuvama Wealth. Please go ahead.\nMahrukh Adajania: Good evening. So, I have a couple of questions. Firstly, on Slide #17, you have given some\nprojections for FY ‘26. And it seems to be reverting back to FY ’24, whereas FY '25 is a big\nblip. So, how do you plan to cover so much ground? What gives you confidence? Especially\nbecause most MFIs are saying that a better part of the recovery including growth will come in\nthe second half. So, what gives you that confidence of covering so much ground? That's my first\nquestion.\nAnd secondly, just in terms of credit cost, forward flows and slippages, you have given some\ndata till April. How does early May look like? And where do you think will you see a meaningful\nor when do you think you will see a meaningful decline in credit cost and some rollbacks as\nwell? So, that's my second question.\nAnd my third question is any size of the equity issue? So, these are my questions.\nAshish Damani: Hi, Mahrukh. This is Ashish. So, I believe you are talking about Slide #12, where we have given\nthe disbursement trends which we had in FY '23 and '24. Is that correct?\nMahrukh Adajania: I am talking about the projection, right? You have given projections and in terms of loans for\nLO, disburses for LO, you have given projections for March 26. That is what I am talking about.\nAshish Damani: Okay, so these projections are for productivity matrices at a loan officer level, which will be a\ncombination of increasing the customer base, doing the disbursements, as well as there is\nattrition that is likely to happen in the branches wherever we would have taken higher number\nof loan officers. So, the idea is to keep looking at that productivity of 340 by the end of this\nfinancial year in terms of the number of customers per loan officer. So, I am not sure if that has\nanswered your question, but that is what we are trying to explain here on this slide.\nIf I can move to your second question in terms of how the current trends are shaping up, how is\nMay looking like and when there will be a meaningful decline? So, yes, March was pretty solid\nat 99% in terms of collection efficiency. However, April and May there has been a slight blip.\nWe are presently trending at about 97% and thereabouts on the current bucket or X bucket.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nLast question was about the size of the transaction. I think we have taken approval from the\nshareholders at about Rs. 750 crores. However, we are looking at presently doing maybe a rights\nissue of, it will obviously be a lower number, but we will have to calibrate the number in due\ncourse.\nMahrukh Adajania: I will come back for more later.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Shreepal Doshi from Equirus. Please go ahead.\nShreepal Doshi: Hi, sir. Thanks for giving me the opportunity. And I think your earlier commentary was very\neasy to understand a lot of aspects, but just had a question on our business model per se. So, are\nwe looking to say, decouple the sourcing and the let’s say, operations and the credit at the ground\nlevel which would also be learning in this cycle per se? Or are we continuing to just go ahead\nwith weekly as a model and continue to have the LO or the loan officer managing both the\nfunctions at the ground level?\nAshish Damani: No, so, weekly, we will continue in the branches where we have the weekly model. We have\nabout 14% of our business in weekly branches. And we would obviously grow that portfolio\ngiven the portfolio quality is definitely better than what we see in monthly branches. On the\nmonthly branches side, I don't think so we are making any changes. It's only about increasing\nthe engagement with the customers by the loan officers.\nShreepal Doshi: So, are we looking at, let's say, having a credit officer at branch level who will look at, let's say,\nunderwriting and we are shifting towards a model which wherein we will be underwriting\nindividual customers while maintaining the JLG model from the operations point of view?\nAshish Damani: Definitely there will have to be a little bit more credit appraisal that needs to be done at a\nborrower level over and above the joint liability that you have on the ground. We are having a\nbranch quality manager, like I have said earlier, at the branches, who is doing further checks in\nterms of understanding the borrowers which are getting onboarded. We have used like I have\nmentioned earlier, we are using technology to improve our understanding of the borrower at the\nground by doing geofencing, by doing liveliness check, making sure that the KYC that we are\ngetting is more robust and more foolproof. This is what we are doing in terms of additional\nchecks.\nShreepal Doshi: The second question was pertaining to something that you also alluded in our earlier\ncommentary, which was on Aadhaar-based, linking Aadhaar of the customer for the new\ncustomer onboarding. So, I think there was a lot of duplication of accounts at system level. And\nso, have we got approval from the RBI to use Aadhaar as a medium to onboard the customer and\nto do even credit bureau check accordingly?\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nAshish Damani: So, Shreepal, we are presently following this e-KYC process where e-sign is the format that we\nuse, where Aadhaar becomes the aspect that you use through OTP-based verification. So, we\nstill don't have the license in terms of AUA or KUA. What we are using is the next stage we will\nmove to is, we are working with the NPCI and others for the e-Setu piece, where we will be able\nto do this much more smoothly. It will be Aadhaar-based customer identification where other\nthan the OTP, there will also be a face recognition that we will use.\nShreepal Doshi: Thank you so much for answering my questions. I will come in the queue for more questions.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Viral Shah from IIFL Capital. Please go ahead.\nViral Shah: Hi, Ashish. Two questions. One is you mentioned that the current X-bucket collection efficiency\ntrends are trending closer to 97%. This is excluding Karnataka or this is at an overall level basis.\nAshish Damani: This is overall. If you exclude Karnataka, it would be about 97.8.\nViral Shah: And another question I have is, see the deferred tax asset that we have recognized in this year,\nnow also this quarter, do you think that is an aggressive estimate given if you look at another\npeer of yours, who has also suffered a couple of quarters of losses, heavy losses, they have\nchosen not to, say, recognize that as a deferred tax asset at least as of now until there is a visibility\nor one delivers profits? Do you think that was an aggressive, I would say, practice that you took\nin this quarter?\nAshish Damani: Viral, I can talk for ourselves. I think what we look at in the deferred tax recognition is how our\nbusiness plan will shape up in the next 5 years. In fact, the authorities allow you to look at the\nnext 8 years and we were sufficiently covered.\nViral Shah: That's it from my side. Thank you, Ashish.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Rajiv Mehta from YES Securities. Please go ahead.\nRajiv Mehta: Hi, Ashish. Just on this borrowing side, this fund raised in the quarter of Rs. 473 crore, can you\ntell us from which sources was this raised? And what percentage of lenders or bank loans will\nbe under covenant breaches and how does the covenant breaches go away? And besides capital,\ncan there be profitability constraints or high liquidity constraints for funding the growth that we\nare planning to have?\nAshish Damani: Sorry, Rajiv, your last question, can you repeat?\nRajiv Mehta: Sir, I am talking about covenant breaches, if you are having any, for the borrowing that we have.\nAnd when does it go away? And whether, you know, besides the capital that we are planning to\nraise, can profitability also act as a constraint for the covenants to remain in place?\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nAshish Damani: Sure. So, the covenant breaches, yes, there have been certain covenant breaches due to both the\nportfolio quality numbers as well as profitability. The number stacks up presently at Rs. 438\ncrores in total where Rs. 260 crores is from the capital markets and about Rs. 178 crores from\nthe term lending side. I see this number start going down in near future. We have got the\nnecessary waivers and comfort from the lenders. They continue to support us. And we don’t see\nthis acting as any kind of a constraint on future growth plans.\nRajiv Mehta: Just on this disbursement activity being low at this point in time and now when you also follow\nthe guardrails of your own self which are tighter than the industry, and then you also given us\nthe cut of your customer base and that 51% of the borrower base currently only eligible for\nincremental disbursements as per the current rules that you are following, when does it really\nchange, the runway change for us?\nBecause I think if you are trying to tell us that like a normal year, the first half will be slightly\ndecreased and second half you can pick up. But when you look at the eligible customer pool,\ncurrently at the start of the year, that seems low. So, how would, I mean, if you can just quantify,\nI mean, would there be any way you can quantify what kind of growth or how do you see the\nyear playing out for yourself in terms of the book by the end of the year?\nAshish Damani: So, I think the industry is slated to grow, let's say, between 10% to 15% with the kind of customer\nbase we have and the numbers that we have kind of put up on the slide, both in terms of existing\nborrowers and the number of borrowers that we would want to bring on board. I think we can\nlook at about 20% kind of the growth from the current base. That's the number that will work\nout.\nRajiv Mehta: Yes, that's it.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashlesh Sonje from Kotak Securities. Please go ahead.\nAshlesh Sonje: Hey, hi, Ashish . Good evening. Sir, the first question is on the employee base. Firstly, do you\nthink you are adequately staffed right now? And secondly, you indicated a few employee-related\nissues in the beginning. Can you broadly quantify what is the amount of money which is\ncurrently outstanding from your employees? Or any magnitude which you can share of the\nemployee related issue?\nAshish Damani: Hi, Ashlesh. So, there is nothing outstanding from the employees or anything which has not been\ndisclosed, or which has not been accounted for. Yes, there have been attritions ,. I mean the\npercentage terms, it was very high for the previous financial year, 56%. And what we have done\nis we have let go, , we have not back filled some of the geographies wherever the borrower to\nloan officer count was much lower than the national average to let it adjust on a normal course,\nthe productivity matrices. And that is something that we will continue to do as we go forward.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nAshlesh Sonje: And in terms of geographies, where do you see higher collection efficiencies and lower\ncollection efficiencies?\nAshish Damani: So, our challenging markets in the recent times have been Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka have been\nthe challenging geographies for us. The rest of the states, while April was a bit lower, May,\nthings are picking up and we are confident that June will be even better, given the monsoon\nsetting in.\nAshlesh Sonje: And just one last clarification. If I go to Slide # 9 on your PPT where you have shared the lender\nlevel overlap, this is as a proportion of borrowers or as a proportion of the loan book?\nAshish Damani: This is at borrower level. But I think in our case, given that the average ticket sizes and average\nloan amount outstanding is relatively uniform, I think both should be more or less in line.\nAshlesh Sonje: Those are all the questions I had.\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Abhishek M from HSBC. Please go ahead.\nAshish Damani: Hi, Abhishek.\nAbhishek M: Hi, Ashish. So, this 20% growth target you saying, that is at AUM or disbursements, which one,\nAUM I am guessing, right?\nAshish Damani: That's right, Abhishek.\nAbhishek M: So, on an absolute level, how much disbursements will be your plan for this year?\nAshish Damani: I think the disbursement number will also be in line with roughly about the AUM size only.\nGiven that most of the disbursement happened towards the second half of the financial year,\nwhich is what we have tried to explain in the PPT on Slide #12, so, more or less, equal amount\nof disbursement is what we will have to do.\nAbhishek M: Wouldn't it have to be higher given you are defocusing on some states? There are obviously a\nlot of customers who are ineligible to be given a repeat loan. So, considering all of that, don't\nyou think disbursements has to go much higher than just 20%?\nAshish Damani: No, I think we have done our math. And what we need to do is get that 53% of the existing\nborrowers to be serviced from the overall bucket. And obviously, there will be new customer\nonboarding that we are starting. So, there will be disbursements from there as well.\nAbhishek M: And in terms of productivity, with 340 per loan officer, is this a sort of new normal which you\nare targeting? Because even '24 you were there and when things went south, you had to increase\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\na lot of people to ease the pressure of collection. Again, don't you think you have to keep slight\nexcess capacity to prepare for a rainy day or do you think 340 builds in it enough excess capacity\nthat can be handled if something goes wrong in any state or any local area?\nAshish Damani: So, FY ‘25 was a relatively challenging year and one would not call it as a BAU in any stretch\nof imagination. I think with the guardrails which have been put in place, we strongly believe that\nthe discipline in the borrowers will improve from here on. And that will definitely ease out the\nchallenges which are being faced by the loan officers on the ground. The fact that the borrower\nis not going to get a fresh loan if they are not paying to all the lenders will definitely help. And\nwith that easing of pressure, I think we should be able to improve on this borrower to loan count\nnumber as we go on.\nMoreover, the tightening on the credit rule that we have done also gives us the confidence that\nthe book that we will build from here on should relatively be easier for the loan officers to\nmanage. So, that number also should help us improve the productivity. And we are also\ntransforming the center penetration. That should also help the loan officers to improve the\nproductivity.\nAbhishek M: And how are you thinking about yields from here? Would you be in any position, I think, one of\nthe banks who does MFI, they took a little bit of an increase in yield. But would you be in a\nposition to increase yields or this is BAU and from here, whatever NIM benefit has to come, has\nto come from basically cost of funds?\nAshish Damani: I think our pricing to the borrowers is pretty fine. The challenge has been primarily on account\nof the quality which has led to reverses on the interest income and impact on the top line. So, I\ndon't see a need or a reason right now to look at the pricing at the borrower level.\nModerator: Your next question comes from the line of Patanjali from Nuvama Crossover Fund. Please go\nahead.\nPatanjali: So, one question. I understand the situation is difficult, but just want to understand when can we\nsee some kind of profitability, in which quarter, say, Q3, Q4? And any kind of guidance that you\ncan give for FY '26? I understand it is difficult, but still.\nAshish Damani: So, I think you are pretty correct when you say that it is a difficult one. I think the right way to\nlook at it is our focus would be to improve on the discipline on the ground, improve on the X-\nbuckets are trending fine. We have to just make sure that it starts stacking up above 99%. And\nas we start improving in terms of our credit rule and making the new portfolio at a better\nefficiency, then I think 99% should be pretty straightforward. And that should help the\nprofitability as we go forward. Giving any number or any guidance at this point in time will be\ngetting ahead of ourselves. So, probably, I think the right way to look at it is, by end of this\nfinancial year, I think the 3rd Quarter onwards, things should start looking up much better.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nModerator: Our next question comes from the line of Abhijit Tibrewal from Motilal Oswal. Please go ahead.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Good evening, Ashish sir. Thank you for taking my questions. Sir, first thing, just trying to\nunderstand, you spoke about the rights issue, planning to do it in Q2. I mean, if you could just\nsort of understand from what we know until now, Kedaara, which is a promoter, they have\nalready taken a one-year extension. And they have to now exit by September 2026. So, does that\nstill hold or under such extraordinary circumstances, we can get a further extension from that\nfund? And B, when we say the promoter is looking to participate in the rights issue, I mean, even\nif there are rights which are denounced by the existing shareholders or the team to pick that up.\nAshish Damani: So, what we presently understand is, you know, they have confirmed their participation. The\ndenouncing and picking up of the other shareholders is something that we will have to look at it\nwhen we get closer to the transaction.\nIn terms of their existing fund and in terms of this, what I understand is they do have time for\n1.5 years from now. And what I understand is that they don't have pressure to do any action on\nthat holding of theirs as of now. And the extension part is something that I believe can be done\nif need be.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: But at least when we say that the promoters are looking to participate, Kedaara is looking to\nparticipate in the rights? issue.\nAshish Damani: Yes.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Ashish, the thing that I wanted to understand is, I mean, you will recall recently when Bharat\nFinancial also reported a lot of discrepancies which were identified in terms of processes,\naccounting, reporting, given that you spoke about the regular audits which are done by RBI in\nthe normal course, have we until now identified anything like that in terms of maybe accounting\nlapses or some reporting lapses between what needs to be classified under interest income or\nwhat needs to be classified under fee income, anything of that sort?\nAshish Damani: No, RBI has not identified anything of that sort. Yes, there has been a discussion with the\nregulator on how we look at the ARC transactions that we have done, but nothing other than\nthat.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: And then lastly, I mean, you kind of spelt out that we will be looking at 20% kind of AUM\ngrowth this year. There are other questions already that people were trying to ask you, when can\nwe get to profitability? Difficult indeed.\nBut, sir, when we speak to MFI industry experts today, all of them say that roughly anywhere\naround 20% to 22% kind of loan losses should be there at the industry level because of whatever\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nMay 30, 2025\nwe went through in the last one year. Last year, our credit costs were roughly around 23%-24%\non the average AUM.\nJust trying to understand from here to next year now, what could transpire into credit costs? One\nis the current GNPA pool that we have. The other thing could be the flows that we are seeing,\nwhich is where we are reporting X-bucket collection efficiencies of around 98.9% thereabouts.\nAnd in addition to that, some BAU credit costs, which are there in the normal course of business.\nSo, how should we look at credit costs then in FY '26?\nAshish Damani: I think on the credit cost bit, the right way to look at it is when do you get into BAU. And that,\nin my mind, should be Q3 or Q4 of this financial year. That is when probably we should start\nseeing the stabilization of the quality in the book. There are some, I am sure you would have\nlooked at our numbers and we do have the Stage 2 bucket which is there. And there would\nobviously be some flows from there. So, the percentages in the first half may be elevated in\nterms of the credit cost. However, in the second half of the financial year, we are positive that\nthese numbers would start normalizing.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: And just one related question, the last question. At least in terms of, I mean, while total\ndisbursements are very low, but at least in terms of the disbursements that we have done in the\nlast maybe six months, there is the portfolio quality holding up well, very low delinquencies or\nI mean, we continue to see flows from the newer disbursements as well, the ones done in the last\nsix months?\nAshish Damani: So, I would say in the last six months again there will be two pieces to it. The guardrails\nimplementation and the free regime so to say. So, it may not be exact comparable kind of a thing.\nHaving said that, I think, the last quarter's disbursement definitely was showing us better\nportfolio quality compared to what we have seen through the year.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: And sir, lastly, I mean, when Shalabh sir resigned and we hosted a call, there were obviously\nquestions around what is the way forward. Any discussions in the Board meeting today on how\nwe are kind of looking to put together the leadership team again?\nAshish Damani: So, if the question is about the leadership team, yes, it was unfortunate to see Shalabh going, but\nthe rest of the team is intact. However, on the CEO bit, I think the Board will do what is in the\nbest interest of the organization and they will definitely follow an approach which is\ncomprehensive, probably evaluating both internal and external candidates to see who fits the\nneed. And idea is to identify a leader who will best align with the long-term strategic priorities\nof the organization.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Thank you so much for patiently answering all my questions. I wish you and your team the very\nbest.\n",

Thank you and over to you, sir.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you very much. Good afternoon to all of you. Thank you for your interest in Spandana\nand for taking time out to join us on this call. While the results have been uploaded, I am\npresenting to you the why of the results. Obviously, the outcome has been below par compared\nto the past 8 quarters of delivery. The team believes that collectively, they should have done\nbetter as it falls short of their expectations as well. However, the team is confident of a\nturnaround back to BAU and it would not take long.\nLet me start with the events in quarter 1. India, as a democracy successfully conducted the largest\never electoral polls in the world to elect members of 18th Lok Sabha. While this 7-phase election\nwas, by and large, normal, it disrupted our company's operations relatively significantly in key\nfive states. We as a policy, post our employees away from their base locations. Hence, we had\nto give them a holiday on the voting day in their place. Plus, we had to close down the operations\nin the locations where we had our branches. That's leading to effectively 2 days of holidays,\nwhich unsettled the center meeting schedule majorly.\nWhile we were grappling with the election disruption, the severe heat wave across large parts of\nIndia was a double whammy that had a higher impact on the attendance, thus leading to an\nunusually higher absenteeism amongst our customers. While these were external factors, we\nwere hit by unusually high attrition in five of our key geographies; Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan,\nGujarat, Maharashtra and Telangana. These geographies have a cumulative AUM, which is 32%\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nof the country's portfolio. Our BM attrition for the quarter in these five states was about 10.5%\nversus 5.91% for rest of India, BM as in the Branch Manager.\nA Branch Manager, as all of us know, is a key stakeholder in running the smooth operations of\nthe branch and he is a 1 point single anchor directing his teams across. So that was a big blow\nin these five states in the quarter 1. Normally, if you see our figures, and we've been monitoring\nour figures, both for the loan officer and Branch Managers, we are relatively better than the\nindustry. These five states, obviously, for quarter 1 was an aberration. And hence, we had an\nattrition of about 10.5% against the rest of the country, which was just 5.9%.\nThese states ultimately led the drag on our portfolio quality, contributing 59% of the arrear\nbucket. That's why it is unusual and unfortunate that all these 3 major events converged in quarter\n1. However, the fact is it did. While it did impact our portfolio quality significantly, our teams\nare back in full force to ensure regularization and bringing back normalcy to the portfolio\ncollections. While the teams are working on the field to normalize, as a means of abundant\ncaution, we have already done the following steps to ensure we tread cautiously over the next\nfew quarters.\nThe following steps have been taken. There is a slide. In fact, there are three slides that we have\nput in the deck. I'm just repeating it for the sake of reemphasizing the point. The first is we have\n-- at this point, we have stopped sourcing new to credit customers. Number two, we've paused\nnew member acquisition in 14% branches across key states. There are about 230 branches where\nwe are not doing member acquisition. These are the branches which have relatively higher\nchallenge on quality compared to the country. So hence, this is the step that we've taken.\nPoint number three, we have restricted new center additions in about 40% branches, 39%\nbranches to be precise. So 1 of the reasons, and I'll cover it during the Q1 and now I can just\ngive you a highlight. One of the reasons why we saw elevated Branch Manager attrition was the\nworkload. So what we have done is, as an immediate action, we have given them one down\nsupport at a credit level. Credit level resources have been put in about 20% of the branches. This\nwill be scaled up to 50% branches by September 2024.\nWhat this will do is, one, divide the workload of the Branch Manager. The minus 1 resource or\nthe credit resources will do all the controls and checks that are required more rigorously. Point\nnumber five, the bench strength in 60% branches has been enhanced by 20% because as a\npreemptive measure of attrition, we are just ensuring that we strengthen our bench strength, so\nthat immediately, there is no disruption.\nAnd the last point is, which is very critical is, our entire supervisors have been enabled or have\nbeen given a monitoring tool, which is a tech-enabled monitoring tool, which monitors all the\nquality parameters and they are visiting the branches, the customers and the centers. So our belief\nis that these six key steps are going to immediately ensure that the portfolio comes back on track.\nThis was the point I wanted to highlight, which is covered, as I said, in the investor deck.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nThe portfolio composition remains comfortable for us from an indebtedness perspective, as the\nfollowing numbers will show. The reason why -- and again, this is a part of the deck, I'm\nreemphasizing the point, because there are a lot of talks in terms of -- is the customer over\nindebted, etcetera. All of you are aware, and we've been bringing this point across over the past\n9 investor calls that we've been doing or we have done.\nWe, at Spandana, monitor the indebtedness level very closely. Our current indebtedness level is\nINR42,000, which is 76% of industry level. And in the deck, we've also given as per the new\nnorms of the SRO which have been announced, we've given how does our flow of customers\nreflect.\nSo we are comfortable on the indebtedness level, number one. Number two, of the total\ncustomers that we have, we have split the customers' indebtedness across the MFI levels, and\nwe've presented it in the slide for all of you to see.\nThe last point in this, I would mention is with tighter control on credit and sharper monitoring,\nWe expect to see an improvement in the portfolio quality. So we believe these challenges are\ntransitory in nature and operations should normalize within the next 3 to 4 months. We have not\ncome across any structural changes, be it in terms of rural demand, be it in terms of dip in income\nlevels or macroeconomic outlook and hence, have reasons to believe that the normalization\nshould happen during the period.\nWith this, let me move to the regular updates for the quarter. During the quarter, we got 2\nupgrades from the existing rating agencies. The first was India Ratings, which upgraded us to\nA+ Stable from A Stable. Then we had ICRA, which upgraded us to A+ Stable from, again, A\nPositive. This was on top of A+ rating from CARE, which was a new rating, which we had\nannounced last quarter.\nMeanwhile, on business front, let me start with update on the 2 new businesses we had launched\nmid of last year in our subsidiary, which is Criss Financial Limited. LAP and Nano loans. The\nnew book that we ended within the quarter was INR88 crores. In fact, happy to inform everyone\nthat we've crossed INR100 crores a couple of days back, which is a new book on secured and\nabout 20%, 25% of the unsecured loans to retailers. But predominantly, it is a book which is\nbiased on secured lending.\nThe book is delivering a yield of 23.75%. While a small portfolio yet, however, is delivering the\ncollection efficiency of almost 100%.\nOn the business drivers, let me just quickly go through. Our disbursement for the quarter was\nINR2,283 crores, which was a growth of 37% Y-o-Y over last year. Q1 is usually a lean quarter\nfor microfinance industry and hence, our quarter-on-quarter disbursement declined by 42%.\nHowever, a Y-o-Y at least -- while the numbers are there, but we do not see any weakening\ndemand. We ourselves tone down the disbursement because we felt it is very important that we\nensure that the quality is restored in the branches.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nAUM at the end of quarter 1 was INR11,723 crores, which was a growth of 72% Y-o-Y.\nCustomer acquisition continues to be our focus. We acquired about 200,000 customers during\nthe quarter. For now, as I have covered, I'm just repeating, for now, we have stopped lending to\nnew to credit borrowers. It's not that -- and I'll cover it in the question-and-answer session. But\nwe've taken this practical step. Once things normalize, we'll kind of pick it up. Our LAP and\nNano business under our subsidiary Criss Financial is growing steadily.\nAs I have already told you, no, we crossed INR100 crores a couple of days back. We have\nambitious plans for this enterprise and this franchise, and we are going on track. We expect these\n2 lines of business to scale up to about INR500 crores by end of the current financial year.\nOn the portfolio quality for the microfinance business, we continue to maintain provisioning at\n80%. The quarter saw GNPA increase to 2.6% from 1.63% a year ago, which is an increase of\nabout 97 bps. Sequentially, GNPA increased by 109 bps, which was reported end of March.\nLikewise, our NNPA for the quarter was 0.53%, up 4 bps over what was reported in the last\nquarter.\nOn the liability and marginal cost of borrowings, while we've given exhaustive slides, just\ncovering the high level, we borrowed about INR1,554 crores, which was almost equivalent to\nwhat we borrowed last year in the same quarter. Sequentially, our borrowing was lower by 55%,\nand this is largely because of the seasonality of our business. Our marginal cost of borrowing\nfor the quarter was 11.4%, which was 87 bps lower than 12.27% for last quarter and 50 bps\nlower than 11.9% reported for quarter 4.\nLikewise, if I look at the borrowing mix, we now have a more healthy mix with bank's\ncontribution increasing to 59% at the end of quarter 1. We intend to optimize our borrowing mix\nwith banks contributing about 60% to 70%, so as to place us in a good position at the cost of\nborrowing fund.\nOn the financial performance side, the net interest income for the quarter increased 47% YoY to\nINR425 crores. The PPOP for the quarter was INR287 crores versus INR189 crores of the same\nquarter last year, this was up 52%.\nYield on the portfolio continues to be strong. It was up 35 bps Y-o-Y to 24.4%. NIM for the\nquarter was 15.2%, which is up 91 bps Y-o-Y and 58 bps quarter-on-quarter. NIMs improved as\na result of lower cost of borrowing. We are working on means to pass on the benefits of\nimprovement to the respective stakeholders, which includes the customers.\nOn the PBT and PAT higher provisions going to the transitionary challenges experienced during\nthe quarter resulted in 53% Y-o-Y decline in the PBT to INR75 crores. PAT for the quarter was\nINR56 crores, which was a drop of 53% Y-o-Y.\nGiven the temporary disruption, we expect to close the financial year with an AUM of around\nINR14,000 crores, and with a slightly elevated credit costs that we've been speaking about, we\ncould end of the year, have a credit cost in the range of about 3.75% for the full year.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nSince the situation is evolving, we will revisit the numbers end of quarter 2. To sum up, we\nbelieve these challenges to be temporary in nature and expect operations to normalize in the\nsecond half of the current year. We have taken a number of steps to improve portfolio quality,\nwhich should help us course correct in the current quarter. We will be prudent in our approach\nto lending, ensuring that our portfolio is well diversified, while staying conservative on ticket\nsizes and customer indebtedness.\nThe entire management team of Spandana is thankful for the consistent feedback that we have\nbeen receiving from all of you. We continue to focus on delivering on targets, which we set for\nourselves and look forward to your continued support.\nSo thank you very much. That was the script that I had. Happy to open this up for questions, so\nthat we could answer all of whatever you would want to ask.\nModerator: Thank you very much. The first question is from the line of Renish from ICICI Bank. Please go\nahead.\nRenish: Hi sir, know this has been a tough quarter, but just 2, 3 questions from my side. So sir, one on\nthis entire Project Parivartan. Though in numbers, it looks like it is progressing well, especially\nwhen we look at the collection efficiency at 98% in weekly branches versus 92% maybe in\nmonthly branches. But again, when we look at the another data point, the 65% of the GNPA\nbeing contributed by the Parivartan branches. So what is the disconnect here? I mean, though it\none end collection is significantly better. And on the other end, a large part of Gross NPAs is\nstill sort of contributed by the Parivartan?\nAshish Damani: This is Ashish. I'll just take this and then maybe Shalabh can also add. Typically, the Parivartan\nbranches, I think the right way to look at Parivartan branches is, these branches are not very\ndifferent from non-Parivartan branches at this point in time, because what we did in the\nParivartan branches was only change the date to a day. We have not yet initiated the weekly\nloans in these branches.\nSo logically, all the issues which happened in the country, like we have explained in our script,\nwhether it was heat wave or for that matter, the disruption in the center meeting because of lack\nof availability of, let's say, either the staff or the customers during the elections or because of the\nheat wave, kind of resulted into a lack of on-time collection, so to say. So there has been a\ndisruption. There have been flows.\nIn fact, if I have to look at the collection efficiency across the 2, there will be hardly any\ndifference at this point in time between the non-Parivartan and Parivartan branches. So what we\nare trying to explain is, yes, Parivartan branches is something that was initiated earlier. But\ntoday, I think it is more about bringing the structural discipline across the branches in terms of\nwhatever we have seen.\nAnd the five states that we have mentioned, have a larger impact. And once we correct things in\nthese five states, either by, let's say, balancing the load at a Branch Manager level staff by giving\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\none more credit guy, or by creating a bench for all the attrition that we have seen, which disrupted\nthe kind of center meetings, or by giving them a little bit of relief from customer acquisition or\ndisbursement, just letting them focus on bringing the customer back into the center meeting and\norganizing those center meetings will be the focus for these branches, including the Parivartan\nbranches should -- correct things on an overall basis. So Parivartan, yes, was a concern in the\npast, but today across the board, I think we are going to focus on these pieces.\nShalabh Saxena: Renish, let me just supplement what Ashish said. The Parivartan branches gap between the\nParivartan and non-Parivartan now is practically very slim now. So which is what if you\nremember about two quarters back, three quarters back, we had said that by end of quarter 1,\nmid of quarter 2, I think we should have normalized, which I think, barring very small bps, some\n50 bps, 60 bps, I think both the branches are at par.\nThe point Ashish is making is the disruption has happened everywhere. So that aside, let me also\nremember, and this is a number that I had said when I think in the quarter 2 call of last year. The\nproblem with Parivartan, whatever historical legacy problem has now flown into the GNPA\nbucket.\nSo 48% of the portfolio was the Parivartan branch portfolio, which is contributing to 65% of the\nGNPA. So yes, it was not accepted the way it should have been. Even though it was with the\nbest of intent, but it didn't work. So that is the reality and the numbers are showing.\nHaving said which now it is practically Parivartan, non-Parivartan is all the same. It doesn't\nmatter. The numbers have regularized. Right now, what we are doing is to ensure that across the\n1,500-1,600 branches, we regularized the disruption and normalize the disruption that had\nhappened. So we've moved on from Parivartan and we are on to normalizing the disruption. The\nnumbers that you see are the inherited legacy of whatever we had launched. So that's the\nsupplement to what Ashish just mentioned.\nRenish Bhuva: just to elaborate a bit on that. So let's say the Project Parivartan was all about moving from a\nmonthly to weekly collection model, right? But when we look at it in the PPT, only 400 branches\nare on weekly collection? When we are saying that we are behind the Project Parivartan, still\nI'm not able to connect the dots over here, sir?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So let me explain. When I made that statement that we are behind, what I meant was that\nthis whole differential and the fact that the flows are because of Parivartan, I was specifically\nmentioning about that. Now the original Project Parivartan, which continues to be, and we will\ndrive that, was to convert the monthly to a weekly. We are still on it. In fact, this is the same\nquestion which was asked by somebody in the last call.\nWe continue to maintain that weekly is a good model. The only difference is that instead of the\n48% of portfolio, which we attempted to convert into Parivartan, we will now go slow, step-by-\nstep, center by center, branch by branch district by district. And any new loan which is given,\nwe will encourage the customer to move to a weekly. This is what was our plan. This continues\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nto be our plan. We have not moved away from weekly into monthly, because we are very sure\nand we are convinced that weekly is a model to go. It is just that we will not really implement it\nat a wholesale level. We will go one step at a time. So instead of a 3 months, 6 months, it could\nprobably take 1 year, 1.5 years. So be it. But obviously, at this stage, we cannot, hazard a\nwholesale conversion from a monthly to weekly. We will do it at a loan by level, center by\ncenter, branch by branch.\nAshish Damani: I'm just trying to sum up. Yes, Parivartan branches had challenges or whatever. But right now,\nthe challenges are across the Board in all branches and that is what we're trying to fix. And in\nthe meantime, yes, Parivartan branches will not be done at that scale, but like Shalabh was\nexplaining, on a smaller set, we will continue to approach. Because weekly, overall, if you would\nhave seen our numbers, we have also given weekly branches in the INR1,400 crores portfolio's\nperformance is at 98% collection efficiency compared to 94% on an overall basis.\nSo clearly, weekly model is much superior to the monthly model. And we continue to believe\nthat, and experience shows that.\nShalabh Saxena: So on a cadence basis, if you see, 25% of our disbursement is weekly. On an AUM basis,\nobviously, AUM operates at a lag, it is about 15%. So this will continue, Renish. And in parallel,\nwe will start moving the customers on weekly. However, not straight away at a wholesale 48%\nor 50% type of a portfolio, we will move center by center, branch by branch, so that things\nremain under control.\nRenish Bhuva: Got it. And sir, just lastly, on the cost of fund and the credit cost part. So when we look at the\nmargins, which is at 15%, and if we believe what is there in the media, etcetera, wherein RBI is\nstill behind the companies for passing on the benefit. So do you foresee any risk to the 15%\nNIM? And hence any risk to the ROA after factoring a higher credit cost at 3.75%?\nAshish Damani: So Renish, 15% NIM is anyways a much higher number than what we have kind of\ncommunicated or guided for. We would like to be around the 14% number, 13.5% to 14%. And\nwe have passed some benefits to the customers in April, starting April 1, where we have reduced\n1% for customers who are in 6 cycle and above. And we keep reviewing this. This quarter from\na cost of borrowing perspective has been very good for the organization at 10.7% in terms of\nmarginal cost.\nHowever, this is also something to do with the fact that we have done a lot many more PTC\ntransactions. When you do some other kinds of borrowings, probably the cost may be slightly\ninching up in the coming quarters. It will be in between whatever we have seen last year and\nwhat we have seen for the quarter. And accordingly, whatever we feel that there is a benefit that\ncan be passed back to the customer. We'll keep deliberating on that.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Renish, let me just supplement what Ashish said. There are two vectors of the two\nvariables that we're working on. First is the absolute cost and the borrowing cost, which is a\nfactor of the mix that we operate, number one. Number two, whatever is the optimization that\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nyou get out of the mix or even otherwise, because we've got now two upgrades and one fresh\nrating, which is A+ Stable. So obviously, some of the impact will kick in by moving the cost of\nborrowings south.\nIf that happens, as I said in my opening remarks also, we will kind of attempt to pass it on to the\ncustomers, which is the first step that we've already taken. We will continue to evaluate that\nposition so as to ensure that we remain fair to the customers at every given point in time.\nOur stated position on NIMs has been that we will operate in a range of about 14,-14.25\nanywhere around that range. You could see one quarter is not a reflection of either a good or\nbad. It is more a consistency which we are kind of wanting to deliver. With this, we'll keep on\nevaluating, and obviously, evaluation happens once we see a stability in the movement across\ntwo, three quarters. So that's how we would position ourselves when it comes to the NIM and\nthe lending rates.\nRenish Bhuva: Alright Sir, just last thing from my side on this collection efficiency or maybe stress at the\nindustry level. If I were to just keep aside this project Parivartan and then when you look at the\ncredit behaviour, etcetera, at the ground level, it is fair to assume that the July collection or the\nJuly trend is better than April, May and June?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So trajectory wise correct, and it will keep on improving is my belief, which is what we are\ngetting to know from when we speak to our people on the ground.\nRenish Bhuva: Okay. So there is no further stress build up, right? I mean keeping aside the Project Parivartan\nat all?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Project Parivartan also, I gave a very elaborate answer. So I think we've moved on, and\nwe will adjust on regularizing everything because we've had a year of Project Parivartan. Now\neverything is regularized, including the numbers. It is just the legacy, which is kind of flowing\nin, which we have to accept and move on.\nWith respect to your specific question on the stress, we've laid out the indebtedness levels in the\npresentations that we've given. We are in a reasonably -- and I speak for our company, we are in\na reasonable position. And as far as the customer indebtedness is concerned, in fact, we are in a\nbetter position. And most importantly, to your last question, are we seeing any specific stress in\na specific geography, the answer is no.\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Aviral Jain from SG India.\nAviral Jain I just want to understand that heat waves and general elections basically got over by 10th June.\nSo are you seeing some signs of improvement in terms of collection efficiency across branches\npost that period, because we have past 6 weeks after that? And it's quite concerning to know that\nthere is increased attrition in 4 or 5 key geographies. What were some of the reasons for that?\nAnd how would you correct it structurally, because that is specific to the company and not\nspecific to the environment?\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nAshish Damani: Aviral, thanks for the questions. I will just take the collection efficiency piece and then let\nShalabh kind of respond to the attrition one. I think this entire collection efficiency piece, yes,\nthere have been green shoots, which we have seen during the month of July. So things have\ndefinitely started improving. Heat wave and all definitely reduced the participation from the\ncustomers, combined with the elections which were going on at that time. We have rolled out\nmany branches in Northern India, where the heat wave was even more strenuous. And that's\nprobably seen in the numbers in the June quarter. But definitely, as we move forward, things\nwill start improving. July has been -- there has been green shoots. I would say there is still scope\nfor a lot of improvement, which we will start seeing from August onwards.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Aviral, let me answer the second part, and it's a very pertinent question, because it's a\ncompany-focused thing. Let me take a step back. Historically, when I see Spandana's attrition\nrates across the loan officer and branch manager level, we've always been doing slightly better\nthan the industry. Our annualized attrition last year, for example, at a Branch Manager level was\n2% per month, roughly about 24% for Spandana. At a LO level, Loan Officer level, we were at\nroughly about 38% to 40% when it comes to loan officer level.\nSo this has been the historical trend. There have been always some spikes here and there in\nstates, but never a convergence into a particular quarter. So this particular quarter, we had these\nfive states, which we've articulated in the slide number three, where we've said that compared to\nour standards itself, while everywhere, there was a bit of an elevated attrition, but these five\nstates kind of had almost, if not double, slightly less than double was the attrition rate.\nThe reasons are as follows. The first is we were reasonably strong in these states. So there was\nan attrition because of an opportunity, because the market presents itself with opportunities.\nThat's number one. Number two, we like it or not, but there is some bit of an additional workload,\nwhich a Branch Manager has to go through, more so from a structure point of view, because in\nour branch, we had a Branch Manager and a Loan Officer.\nThat is why what we have immediately done is that we've put, as I mentioned in my opening\nremarks, in 20% of the branches, the branches which were big had a pause and a customer\nstrength level, we've added people. We've given support to the branch managers so that he is\nable to focus on the other things and not -- because right now, the administrative and the\nsupervisory responsibility is with them. So that's what we've done immediately in the 20% of\nthe branches as we speak. We already have people positioned.\nWe've said that by September end, we will have 50% of the branches have these additional\nsupport. So this will give some respite to the branch manager. The last one is, obviously, what\nwe have done is at just a branch manager is not going to solve the problem. So we've already\nstarted putting people and creating an additional bench of 20% at every of the critical branches,\nwhich is almost about 70%, 75% branches, where we'll have additional bench strength of about\n20% additional. So that if there is an attrition at a loan officer level also, we are able to address\nthat.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nThis is apart from the other engagement activities, recognitions, etcetera, that we are continuing\nto pursue and will continue to strengthen. So point is valid, these five states bore the brunt of the\nhigher exodus. But we've taken the corrective measures and corrective steps the moment we\nkind of saw the data in the first couple of months itself. And I think the last month, which is\nJuly, while we're still not out of July, but we are seeing -- I mean, between July and August, I\nthink we should be normalized on the attrition front. As an institution, we take pride in the fact\nthat we've been able to hold on to our resources for the past 2 years. This was an aberration and\nit should be looked at in that light.\nAviral Jain: My final question, I'll dwell on these credit costs, you had mentioned that this year as of things\nthat we see today, you are envisaging a 3.75% sort of a credit cost. Does that mean that there is\nfurther slippages that you are envisaging?\nYes, we are at 80% PCR already. So any further incremental credit cost has to be driven by fresh\nslippage, which again looks -- if the business has come back to normalcy from a fresh slippages\nstandpoint, it's a very high number compared to the past 7, 8 quarters?\nAshish Damani: Yes, that's pretty accurate. It has been a higher number compared to the last 7, 8 quarters.\nProbably, we will see this kind of stabilizing towards August and September. And from Q3, Q4\nonwards, it's should completely be BAU, that's the expectation. So credit cost in that light in the\nremarks kind of Shalabh alluded to that we are likely to be around the 3.75% number for full\nyear. Definitely, this is much higher than what we envisaged. In fact, our guidance was more\nlike 2.5% when we had our call last quarter. But basis what we have seen in the first quarter,\nprobably we are...\nShalabh Saxena: So Aviral, what happens is that on a distribution of 14,000 employees, INR12,000 crores across\n1,600 branches and about 3.4 million customers, when you have this kind of an impact, it will\ntake at least one additional quarter to kind of come back to normalcy because what you could do\nis to reinitiate the entire effort of reaching out to the customers and trying to clear off whatever\nwent through the earlier buckets. So we will take about a quarter more, which is this quarter is\nwhat I'm saying, just to clarify.\nAnd I think Q3, Q4, and that's what we've said also in H2, we believe will be normal. We will\nsee some elevated costs because the flows are there, we are still managing. But a normalcy\nshould be restored by end of this quarter. We will need at least those 4, 5 months of period to\nkind of come out of it.\nAviral Jain: Yes, that I know that is completely fair. My question was that would you see more incremental\nand 30+ plus addition over this time. Finally come back normalcy in the next 3, 4 months?\nBecause ultimately, I'm saying, the credit cost would be defined by how much provision\ncoverage you need for each of the buckets?\nAshish Damani: Yes. So the credit cost for the full year, as Shalabh mentioned, was probably around 3.75%.\nThere are going to be a little bit more flows in the coming quarters. But there is likely to be\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nimprovement in the 30 to 90 bucket where we have almost INR160 crores of provision setting\nright now. So clearly, it will be a bit of slippages, but some bit of upgrades as well when we are\ngiving out number.\nAviral Jain: Okay. Let's see. Maybe at the end of second quarter, we'll have clarity as to what was the fact\nand my point was that sir, just to complete, what I was saying was this looks like a temporary\nphenomenon given multiple factors, but some of the credit costs could get reversed. I am being\nslightly optimistic, again, on ground situation we'll kind of say, but this would be temporary in\nnature?\nShalabh Saxena: Absolutely. And that's our belief because see, there's inherently nothing wrong with the\ncustomers. See one should be worried when you see a spike in the so-called not-so-good\ncustomers, which doesn't look like. The issue with this whole model here is that if a customer\nslips, you have to work doubly hard to ensure and work with the customer to ensure you recover\nand ensure that she backflows her SMA bucket moves in the reverse, which is where the\nchallenge comes.\nThere's nothing inherently wrong in the customer in our belief. In the process here, something\nwill flow. But as long as you are able to squeeze the fresh flows from a standard into SMA\nbucket, I think another 2, 3 months, we should be fine. And we believe that that's what the belief\nof the team that while this quarter could see some more flows, obviously, but not to the extent\nof whatonewould believe. So that's the reason when I said the 3.75, that was the number that we\nsaid. And then Q3, Q4, I think we completely should be fine.\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Ajay Modi from Piper Serica PMS.\nAjay Modi: Quickly, Shalabh, while on the last questions, the response kind of feels like this is actually\ntransitory. I would like to kind of rephrase and ask this once again. The slippages in 30 to 60\nand 60 to 90 buckets have been very sharp. I mean, 0.92% to 1.68% Q-o-Q and 0.64% to 1.47%\nQ-on-Q. And this is at a time when we've been reading about sudden telling the industry\nparticipants to go slow on -- or stop exposure to borrowers with more than 2 lakh of exposure,\nplus the industry kind of talking about setting up a so-called support fund of INR500 crores. And\nat a time when there is loan waiver already kind of starting from states like Telangana. So does\nit get worse in Q2, Q3 before it kind of actually starts settling down?\nShalabh Saxena: No. So Ajay, I think if you go to our investor deck, slide five, we have put out our customers'\ncohorts across the various indebtedness level. If you see, only 0.7% of our borrowers are more\nthan INR2,00,000. Rest everything is -- about half of them are under INR50,000, which goes\nback to point, and it has nothing to do with this specific quarter. For the last nine quarters, we've\nbeen stressing on three, four things, Ajay.\nThe first is that we, as a company, we measure and focus and monitor customer indebtedness,\nnumber one. We believe that the ticket size is not a game to play. our maximum ticket size on\nour loan is INR80,000, no more.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nProbably this would be the lowest in the industry, but then we are okay with that number two.\nNumber three, Ajay, and this I did not mention in my earnings call, nor is it there on the slide.\nThe rejection rate as a result of theFOIR , which is in existence at this point in time, our company\nrejection rates are 51%. So what I source, I say no to half of them because of the so-called\nindebtedness. And that goes back to, once again, the shorter tenure loans that we've been\npropagating all along.\nWhile our maximum tenor on the loan is 24 months. And we put out in our slide, on the monthly\nloans, we are 12%, 86% is a 24 months, rest everything is about 14% is 12 and 18 months. If\nyou see the weekly loans, we are 68%, 12 and 18 months loan, and we have just about 32%, 24\nmonths loan. So the philosophy of lending short, lending muted ticket sizes, focusing on\nindebtedness is what we are focused on, and we've put up the numbers that you alluded to, right\nhere up front. So this is our spread.\nAnd hence, back to the previous question, which was answered, our confidence on the customers\nfrom an indebted point of view is high. If there are -- there could be other issues, there could be\nother reasons. But over leveraging, etcetera, does not -- at least the data doesn't suggest, nor does\nour interaction with the customers suggest. So that's the, sorry, long answer to your question,\nbut that's our belief.\nAjay Modi: Okay. So I have seen the slide that you are mentioning to. And my question was more, and I am\njust trying to understand more from an industry standpoint, while definitely for you about 48%\nborrowers are below INR50,000. So that's very good as an industry number. What I'm simply\ntrying to understand is, from a microfinance industry standpoint, is there a stress building up in\nthe overall industry that we may kind of see in the coming quarters, or was Q1 more of largely\ntaken the impact?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Q1, my personal belief and having looked at multiple data points, I personally do not\nbelieve there is a systemic over-leverage issue across the industry. I firmly believe that. There\ncould be a few pockets, a few institutions here and there. But my sense is -- forget Spandana,\nmy sense is that it will at best to be in a single digit, cannot be more. So that's number one.\nNumber two is when it comes to the industry, what are the issues the industry is facing today?\nThe industry has to look at, and it is true of us as well. We have to ensure that we look at attrition\nacross the levels, particularly at the branch level for the widespread distribution that we have.\nSo attrition is something that one should be looking at.\nAnd the controls and supervision to ensure that the instances of misappropriation / frauds are\nreduced, so these are the three things that one should be looking at. My personal opinion is that\ninstead of over-leverage, I think these are the two things every company should be looking at,\nand I'm sure every company is looking at.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nAjay Modi: Okay. One quick support question here. So the minus 1 credit officer that you've instituted in\n20% of your branches, can you give a little bit of profile of these officers, just for an\nunderstanding perspective?\nShalabh Saxena: We lost you for the first five seconds. So we picked you up from the minus 1, so if you could\nrepeat the first one.\nAjay Modi: I was just asking the credit level resources that you put in 20%, I'd say the minus 1 to the branch\nmanagers. Can you just share a little bit of profile of these officers?\nShalabh Saxena: So these officers, so our criteria is that they should have -- so we have a performance criteria,\nwe have a vintage criteria, and we are picking people from our company, people who've been\nwith us for more than two years, vintage with us, number one. Number two, as loan officer\nShalabh Saxena: So what we do is to ensure that there is a cultural synergy, the minus 1 profile is somebody who's\nworked with us for two yearsas a loan officer obviously, number one. Number two, he should\nhave delivered some performance criteria standards that we put in. Number three, we ensure that\nthere shouldn't be any -- from a discipline and conduct point of view, he should be completely\nabove board.\nSo, they go through our assessment process because there are quite a lot of eligible candidates\naround, they go through a process and then they are posted as a minus 1 to the branch manager.\nObviously, this is a bench for the branch manager. After a year, they become eligible for a branch\nmanager promotion.\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Rajiv Mehta from YES Securities.\nRajiv Mehta: Just a couple of questions. Firstly, if you can share what is the PAR of 1 to 30 bucket? And\nfollow-up is what can be done from collections to strengthening point of view to stop the forward\nflow or at least stem the forward flow of already delinquent customers who are in 30-60, 60-90\nbucket?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Rajiv, as I mentioned, we've kind of increased the -- we've increased the bench strength\nat a branch level, as I mentioned, 20% additional manpower has been put in. Our experience is\nthat once a customer flows, all it needs is persuasive efforts to ensure you're engaged with the\ncustomer for, one, the same month collection. And the second one is the additional one, which\nshe would have missed out.\nSo this micro monitoring at a customer level is what each of these branches are exposed to and\neach of these branches are being guided to. In the first phase, we have about 822 branches where\nwe put up these additional resources who are along with the branch manager and the credit\nofficer wherever the person has been appointed, together they go and they kind of monitor and\nthey engage with the customer to ensure that there's a sufficient traction built for the reverse.\nThat's number one.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nNumber two is, Rajiv, what we are also doing is to ensure that the fresh sourcing that we do is\nonly under control and hence the job description of the minus 1 resource is just to ensure that\nthe profile and the quality of the customer is very well understood. We have a chat with the\ncustomer. This is outside of the loan officer and the branch manager who would have already\nengaged with the customer, do all the quality checks before the customers -- before the proposal\nis pushed for disbursal.\nSo we are not in a hurry to disburse. We are taking our time to ensure that it passes through all\nthe quality checks before a loan is done. So this is on both the earlier collection as well as the\nfresh proposal. To your question on the 1 to 30, it’s typical. If you see the past trends also, it is\n1 to 30 equivalent to your 31 to 90. So at this point in time, it is 3.1%, 3.2%.\nRajiv Mehta: Is this the whole -- is this the part 1 to 30 or...?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, 1 to 30.\nRajiv Mehta: Okay. And see, we have stopped acquisition of new to credit customers in certain branches,\nmaybe post a new member acquisition in 14% branches. The new center addition has been\nrestricted in 39% of branches. So what will make us lift these restrictions because at some point\nin time, you will start to even grow in these impacted locations. So is there any benchmarking\nin terms of say, the general parameters like collection efficiency or the PAR being brought down\nto a certain level, post which we will more open up in terms of customer acquisition and growth?\nShalabh Saxena: Absolutely. So Rajiv, we have -- for each of the elements that have been put out on the slides,\nwe have our internal benchmark, which we put up where we will start opening up the gates. At\nthis point in time, our belief is getting the portfolio back in control is very important. And hence,\nwe've taken all those steps. Internally, yes, for each of the branches have been given a mandate\nthat you cross this milestone, this gate opens. You cross another milestone, this gate opens.\nAcross the branches, what we have definitely not done is to not stop loans to the existing\nmembers who are paying well. Obviously, that channel remains open. But otherwise, for every\nsingle of the milestones that have been put up, which includes center addition, which is at this\npoint in time applicable to about 510-odd branches, the member acquisition has been paused in\nabout 223 branches and so on and so forth. So every single branch has a milestone to cross and\nthen they kind of move up the ladder.\nRajiv Mehta: Just one last thing on this INR2,300 crores disbursement, which we did in this quarter. So I'm\nsure this has been a much lesser impacted or kind of relatively much, much better markets than\nwe would have disbursed. So can you maybe call out which are the better markets at this point\nin time, which are performing better versus the problems what you see in some of the impacted\nmarkets?\nShalabh Saxena: So the five states that we've already put out, Rajiv, those are the five states which have borne\nthe brunt of whatever has been the quality interruption. I think outside of that, we personally\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\ndon't believe that -- I mean the numbers don't tell any different story from what we put out in\nthe slides.\nSo these are the five states where we are -- I mean there is a differential of about -- if my memory\nserves right about 300 bps between these five states and the non-five states. So overall, once if\nwe are able to correct and we are -in these five states regularized, I think we should be good.\nRajiv Mehta: Sorry, just one clarification. You said 300 bps difference in collection efficiency?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So overall quality matrix -- collection efficiency is the first, because GNPA has gone, we\ncan’t do anything about it. But we measure various -- we see the flow rates. We see the early\ndelinquencies and so on and so forth. All of that, if I combine, there is that bit of a difference\nbetween these five states and the non-five states.\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Shreepal Doshi from Equirus Securities.\nShreepal Doshi: So the question was pertaining to this high attrition. So this seems pretty sudden in nature. So\nhave we looked at what are the reasons? Is it the entry of a number of new lenders in these states,\nor what is it like? Because this sort of an attrition looks pretty sharp. I mean, maybe the zonal or\nregional managers would have got some hint of this sort of event. So just if you can elaborate\non this?\nShalabh Saxena: So for the specific, Shreepal, the point you are making on terms of entry is for the state of\nTelangana. That is the only state where others are not there and they are coming. So is there an\nimpact? We have some INR320 crores of portfolio across the INR12,000 crores in Telangana.\nSo is that one reason? So I'm saying, see, it is not about whether you -- and the attrition is in\nstates where everybody or the other people have been around, the competition has been around.\nOur personal experience is that microfinance to microfinance, people attriting into another\nmicrofinance company is a small portion of the attrition. People tend to kind of go out of the\nindustry because there are enough opportunities that exist. So specifically, and we've done a lot\nof analysis for all the employees who've gone across not just these five states, but across all the\nstates that we operate. There isn't a specific trend of some 50% people moving into another\nmicrofinance company. It's a small portion. It is a portion, but it is definitely not a large portion\nworth measuring.\nWhat gets to the people is the general fatigue having worked for long in microfinance, the\nstrenuous nature and the drill that goes into this. So every person takes every pressure differently.\nAnd if it is a sustained pressure over the years, then people react differently. And I agree with\nyou, these five states only in this quarter. So nothing has -- I mean the only thing that we can\nand we've done, we spoke to all of them after they had exited and all of them.\nIt's a combined nature of staying away from the family and a lot of hours being put in this apart\nfrom the workload, etcetera, which leads them to sort of move on either in the industry or outside\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nthe industry. But there's no specific one line trend that I can give you an answer saying because\nof this, they left or X company took them or Y company took them.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it. Sir, the other question is little industry-wide. So while speaking with other MFI\nmanagement as well, I mean these are the five, at least Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, MP\ncomes across as common states in terms of asset quality issues. While our reasons are, of course,\nlittle company specific, the other peers have indicated more industry-wide issue, while our\nstance is a little different. So I'm not able to connect the two, because...\nShalabh Saxena: No. So let me clarify. For Spandana, these five states, the flows have been accentuated because\nof the reasons that I have mentioned. Inherently, there are issues in pockets in the states that\nyou've mentioned. So it is not that everything is hunky dory for us and -- but for this they too\nwould have been resolved. That's not the point.\nThe point is that there are challenges and there are challenges in these locations. We were able\nto manage to a large extent, even at that time, if you go back to Q4 and Q3 of last year, not these\n5, but at least 3 states had a slightly elevated deterioration, if I may call so, in the -- compared\nto the rest of the country.\nWhat we are trying to say is that the reason these five states, the number has been accentuated\nbecause of the experienced branch manager leaving. Obviously, we put the experienced people\nback and we are back to business, and I'm just clarifying that. It's not a stand-alone, it is a 1 plus\n1.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it. Sir, just last question. If you look at the Stage 2 coverage, maybe Ashish sir can also add\nin here. The Stage 2 coverage has seen a very sharp increase from say, 37%, 38% to almost 47%,\n48%. I mean, if you could just elaborate on this?\nAshish Damani: So Shreepal what we did was we have updated the model last quarter, if you recall, and we have\nkind of smoothened the data across the 8-year period in the ECL model and have taken out all\nthe biases, which were running in the model from a, let's say, COVID-perspective or from a\nDemonetisation perspective or any other aberration that was there in the business?\nWe have actually now ignored all of that and let the data only smoothen across the buckets of\nthe periods. What we have done is we've taken monthly data for last 8 years, and that has been\nbuilt into the model as a driver. This kind of led to an increase in the bucket requirements of the\nflows of the PD rates for both Stage 1 and Stage 2 which was implemented last quarter. So this\nquarter, just to clarify thisquarterv, there has not been any change. We have just sticked to the\nmodel as is and whatever has been coming out has been provided for.\nShreepal Doshi: Just one data keeping I think somebody else also asked what is par 1 to 30 bucket a number?\nAshish Damani: 3.2% is 1 to 30 bucket.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it. Thank you so much and good luck for the next quarter.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Abhijit Tibrewal from Motilal Oswal Financial\nServices. Please go ahead.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Based on questions from these 5 specialist individuals who asked questions before me, I mean,\nI'm sure you can very well make out what most of us analysts and investors are trying to\nunderstand is what the MFI sector is going through now is transient in nature, more like\ndisruption from elections or heat waves and will course correct itself in the next 3 to 6 months\nfrom now or is this a credit cycle in the works because of, I mean, reasons which are unexplained\nas of now. You also referred to this leverage which is actively being tracked by all players today.\nSo I had two questions. You have cut your AUM growth guidance for this fiscal year based on\nwhat you saw in 1Q, you've also increased your credit cost guidance to 3.75% versus 2.5% until\nlast quarter. So I mean while a lot of discussion has already happened on this subject, what I'm\ntrying to understand is if we are so confident of things normalizing after, let's say, 3 months from\nnow in the second half of the fiscal year?\nThen, I mean, what was the need for this increase in credit cost guidance? Now why I'm asking\nthis is if you look at this quarter's credit cost almost INR210 crores, maybe around INR5 crores,\nINR6 crores is towards write-offs. Rest of it is towards provisioning on Stage 3 and Stage 2\nloans.\nSo if it was just heat wave, if it was just an election impact where someone could have missed\nan EMI because of operational reasons. And if they start repaying , then your guidance cannot\ngo up, right, because your guidance is going up from 2.5% to 3.75% is because you're expecting\nmore write-offs to come through, not necessarily because of higher provisioning. Had it been\nhigher provisioning, they would actually have got reversed when the asset quality would have\nimproved from collections? So what am I missing here is something I'm trying to understand.\nAshish Damani: I will just take this question and probably Shalabh may add if there is something missed out.\nAbhijit, the right way to look at it is, one, at the industry level, you have said and I think at the\nindustry level, our belief was that the new norm is definitely a base of 2%, which is now hovering\nbetween, let's say, 2% and 2.5%. But given what we have seen in the first quarter like Shalabh\nwas explaining earlier definitely what we have seen in the first quarter in terms of credit cost is\nsomething has been higher than our own estimates.\nAnd this 3.75% is the outcome of what we have seen in the first quarter. There are improvements\nthat we are confident of seeing, but those improvements are likely to play out, let's say, in the\nnext 3 to 4 months. So in the interim, there are likely to be some flows. And probably we have\ntaken into account those flows and improvements also subsequently, and that's how the\nguidance.\nI think in the initial narrative that Shalabh gave, he also talked about there has been a little bit of\nreduction in our overall business numbers for the year. And that probably will give you some\nincrease on a percentage terms basis. So these are the factors which are at play, and that's how\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nwe have kind of changed the course on the guidance. However, we have also said that this is an\nevolving situation. We are looking at this. And if, let's say, the improvement is much more, then\nwe will obviously come back and keep discussing these numbers or the outlook going forward.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: So I mean, if I understand this correctly, the way we kind of summarize this is that given that\nthis is an evolving situation, if things are better than what you are expecting right now, you will\nmaybe revisit your credit cost guidance. If that were not to happen, then what will happen is,\nafter 3 to 6 months, collections are expected to improve -- but the slippages, which have\nhappened not just in 1Q, but we've been seeing slippages in 3Q and 4Q of the last fiscal year as\nwell. They will reflect in your Stage 2 and Stage 3 and will eventually get written off? Is that\nright understanding in terms of -- if credit costs were to remain at 3.75%?\nAshish Damani: Yes, that's right, because if the customers have already moved into either a GNPA bucket or if\nthe customer is in 60 bucket, the improvement from there is difficult. It will be slow. However,\nthere are recoveries. It's not that the recoveries are zero. Definitely, there are recoveries.\nAnd since the challenges have been more from a, let's say, administrative disruption or because\nof lack of availability in the center meeting and during that time, and it was not the intent of the\ncustomer. We are very hopeful that things will improve. This will not be a normal flow that if it\ngoes down then it goes down it will not be like that. But we don't want to get ahead of ourselves\nand put the numbers out right now, we will see how things will play out. Efforts will be made\n100%. We have already looked at what are the things that are required to fix this on structural\nbasis, and that's what has been articulated in the document, putting in people, strengthening the\nmonitoring staff at the branch level.\nLooking at how can we improve the monitoring at every stage by using technology. For that\nmatter, reducing the workload of the branch from a disbursement standpoint, focus, let them\nfocus more on the portfolio quality and improving the discipline at the center level. These are\nthe things which people will be focusing more, at least for next, let's say, 4 to 5 months. And\nthat would yield results. On either basis, how things will flow move on, we will get to know in\nthe next 2 to 3 months.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. Sir, just 1 last question that I had is -- I mean, you've already answered this partly in prior\nquestions. But what I'm just kind of trying to understand is, I mean, how are the yields still\nimproving for us when you're already seeing broad-based yield moderation in the sector? And\ndespite the significant increase in our Stage 3, why is it that I mean, interest income reversals\nare not visible which should have impacted your interest income and yields?\nAshish Damani: So two things here. One is, I think this is also linked to the last question which Shreepal asked.\nIn Stage 2 itself, we kind of see 50% provisioning that we do. And from 52 moving to 80%\nwould mean additional 30% of reversal or the impact normally when things move into Stage 3.\nBut this is partly the answer. The other part on the yield side is the mix for us has been improving\nover the quarters. We were earlier, if you recall, we have 2-year loans largely. And the loans\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nuntil October of '22 were given at even 22%. From there we moved to 25% in two parts and\nthat's how the yield was improving on overall basis. That is one aspect.\nThe second aspect is whenever we are doing DA transactions as you know the interest income\nwill move from the interest income line into the net gains line item. And that also has an impact\non the ratio. This quarter we had zero DA. I mean if we were to compare it from the previous\nquarter then that definitely has a positive bearing on the yield on the NIMs and things like that.\nThat's why we are saying on a steady-state basis one should look at a NIM of 13.5% to 14%,\nmore like around 14% to be a standard steady-state NIM for us.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. Sir, I think this is useful. Ashish sir, I'll just leave you with a thought. I will connect with\nyou maybe offline, but one thing that I'm not able to comprehend is. I mean we've always said\nthese MFI customers who should never doubt their intention and willingness to repay when we\ncome across a quarter where elections and heat waves bring out operational challenges, where\nmaybe 1 or 2 EMIs could not be collected. But if the willingness and intent of the customer is\nthere, why is it that, I mean, these things should lead to basically write-offs, is something I'm\nnot able to wrap my head around?\nAshish Damani: Certainly, we'll connect on this offline. Abhijit, just one line. The reason we are saying we are\nvery hopeful in terms of improvements is precisely the reason which you have articulated that\nintention is not a problem. It is an administrative disruption that we are dealing with, it's a\ntemporary issue with us at the customer level. And there are other challenges in terms of\naddressing this which we will discuss maybe offline.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Great. Thank you so much and all the very best to you and your team.\nModerator: Ladies and gentlemen due to time constraints, we will just take last two questions. The next\nquestion is from the line of Janavi Bapat from Hara Capital. Please go ahead.\nJanavi Bapat: Hello. I wanted to quickly ask if there is any pattern in attrition in the Parivartan branches versus\nnon-Parivartan branches.\nAshish Damani: So there is no pattern per se in Parivartan versus non-Parivartan. It is more towards the states,\nJahnvi, and that's why we have kind of called out those states where there was a higher attrition.\nJanavi Bapat: Okay. And the last 1 is, since you've provided a good breakup of the indebtedness of the\nborrowers. Is it possible also to provide broadly the income distribution of the borrowers, say\nhow many households are like below 1 lakh or between 1 lakh to 2 lakh, 3 lakh, something on\nthose lines?\nAshish Damani : We will give you this data offline because I don't have it readily available, but largely, these\nnumbers are more that our guys discuss with the customer. I mean this is not a very reliable set\njust I'm trying to say because it is more of a discussion and assessment that is being done by the\nloan officers, and that's how it is being worked out. Having said that, we will give you whatever\nnumbers we have.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nJanavi Bapat: Got it. Thank you so much.\nModerator: Thank you. The last question is from the line of Sarvesh Gupta from Maximal Capital. Please\ngo ahead.\nSarvesh Gupta: Sir, your performance relative to your peers, it looks like on a much, much weaker set of numbers\noverall. So what can be the reason why we are particularly hit much more than the industry. Of\ncourse, all the players have reported weaker results. But I think your results are probably at the\nbottom percent, 25 percentile. So any specific reason with respect to our policies or our\nmanagement of this entire election season how we have been disproportionately impacted? This\nis something I could not understand.\nShalabh Saxena: So Sarvesh, every company operates a different model, has different way in which it functions\nand has a different environment in which it operates. The numbers are there for everyone to see,\nso nobody can doubt or dispute it. All we know for sure is that for the last 9 quarters, there is a\ncertain set of patterns that we had and we had observed. This one quarter had some disruption,\nprobably as we've kind of very -- in an elaborate way we've articulated the reasons which were\nthe states which kind of dragged the portfolio down. And that's the reason why we've a result,\nwhich is what all you and I see.\nHaving said, which -- what is very critical is that -- what is the profile of the customer? Is the\ndeterioration or is the quality which has gone down south, Is it because of a structural reason?\nIs there something that you are doing, which is very different from what the industry is doing?\nThe answer is no. We have evaluated and which is what I covered in my commentary also, the\nnature, there is no structural difference in the way we operate from the industry. Yes, we have\ncertain norms or certain philosophies in which we operate, which are from credit point of view,\nwhich are more on the conservative side. So if not today, tomorrow, it will show up.\nBut at this point in time, all I would want to say is that the disruption was accentuated by the\nattrition which has led us to where we are. And we'll take a quarter to recover post which then I\nthink things should be BAU.\nModerator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will take that as the last question. I would now like to hand the\nconference over to the management for closing comments.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you very much for joining this call. Thank you for the patience. We took an extra about\n20, 25 minutes of call just to ensure that we are able to communicate what happened during the\nquarter and what is the way ahead for us. For all those who couldn't ask specific questions you\nhave our coordinates, you can get in touch with us and we'll be very happy to kind of provide all\nthe clarifications. Thank you for all the support and thank you for joining the call.\nModerator: On behalf of Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited, that concludes this conference. Thank you\nfor joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines.\n",

Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI now hand the conference over to Mr. Shalabh Saxena, MD and CEO of Spandana Sphoorty\nFinancial Limited. Thank you and over to you, sir.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you very much. Good afternoon to all of you. Thank you for your interest in Spandana\nand for taking time out to join us on this call. While the results have been uploaded, I am\npresenting to you the why of the results. Obviously, the outcome has been below par compared\nto the past 8 quarters of delivery. The team believes that collectively, they should have done\nbetter as it falls short of their expectations as well. However, the team is confident of a\nturnaround back to BAU and it would not take long.\nLet me start with the events in quarter 1. India, as a democracy successfully conducted the largest\never electoral polls in the world to elect members of 18th Lok Sabha. While this 7-phase election\nwas, by and large, normal, it disrupted our company's operations relatively significantly in key\nfive states. We as a policy, post our employees away from their base locations. Hence, we had\nto give them a holiday on the voting day in their place. Plus, we had to close down the operations\nin the locations where we had our branches. That's leading to effectively 2 days of holidays,\nwhich unsettled the center meeting schedule majorly.\nWhile we were grappling with the election disruption, the severe heat wave across large parts of\nIndia was a double whammy that had a higher impact on the attendance, thus leading to an\nunusually higher absenteeism amongst our customers. While these were external factors, we\nwere hit by unusually high attrition in five of our key geographies; Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan,\nGujarat, Maharashtra and Telangana. These geographies have a cumulative AUM, which is 32%\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nof the country's portfolio. Our BM attrition for the quarter in these five states was about 10.5%\nversus 5.91% for rest of India, BM as in the Branch Manager.\nA Branch Manager, as all of us know, is a key stakeholder in running the smooth operations of\nthe branch and he is a 1 point single anchor directing his teams across. So that was a big blow\nin these five states in the quarter 1. Normally, if you see our figures, and we've been monitoring\nour figures, both for the loan officer and Branch Managers, we are relatively better than the\nindustry. These five states, obviously, for quarter 1 was an aberration. And hence, we had an\nattrition of about 10.5% against the rest of the country, which was just 5.9%.\nThese states ultimately led the drag on our portfolio quality, contributing 59% of the arrear\nbucket. That's why it is unusual and unfortunate that all these 3 major events converged in quarter\n1. However, the fact is it did. While it did impact our portfolio quality significantly, our teams\nare back in full force to ensure regularization and bringing back normalcy to the portfolio\ncollections. While the teams are working on the field to normalize, as a means of abundant\ncaution, we have already done the following steps to ensure we tread cautiously over the next\nfew quarters.\nThe following steps have been taken. There is a slide. In fact, there are three slides that we have\nput in the deck. I'm just repeating it for the sake of reemphasizing the point. The first is we have\n-- at this point, we have stopped sourcing new to credit customers. Number two, we've paused\nnew member acquisition in 14% branches across key states. There are about 230 branches where\nwe are not doing member acquisition. These are the branches which have relatively higher\nchallenge on quality compared to the country. So hence, this is the step that we've taken.\nPoint number three, we have restricted new center additions in about 40% branches, 39%\nbranches to be precise. So 1 of the reasons, and I'll cover it during the Q1 and now I can just\ngive you a highlight. One of the reasons why we saw elevated Branch Manager attrition was the\nworkload. So what we have done is, as an immediate action, we have given them one down\nsupport at a credit level. Credit level resources have been put in about 20% of the branches. This\nwill be scaled up to 50% branches by September 2024.\nWhat this will do is, one, divide the workload of the Branch Manager. The minus 1 resource or\nthe credit resources will do all the controls and checks that are required more rigorously. Point\nnumber five, the bench strength in 60% branches has been enhanced by 20% because as a\npreemptive measure of attrition, we are just ensuring that we strengthen our bench strength, so\nthat immediately, there is no disruption.\nAnd the last point is, which is very critical is, our entire supervisors have been enabled or have\nbeen given a monitoring tool, which is a tech-enabled monitoring tool, which monitors all the\nquality parameters and they are visiting the branches, the customers and the centers. So our belief\nis that these six key steps are going to immediately ensure that the portfolio comes back on track.\nThis was the point I wanted to highlight, which is covered, as I said, in the investor deck.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nThe portfolio composition remains comfortable for us from an indebtedness perspective, as the\nfollowing numbers will show. The reason why -- and again, this is a part of the deck, I'm\nreemphasizing the point, because there are a lot of talks in terms of -- is the customer over\nindebted, etcetera. All of you are aware, and we've been bringing this point across over the past\n9 investor calls that we've been doing or we have done.\nWe, at Spandana, monitor the indebtedness level very closely. Our current indebtedness level is\nINR42,000, which is 76% of industry level. And in the deck, we've also given as per the new\nnorms of the SRO which have been announced, we've given how does our flow of customers\nreflect.\nSo we are comfortable on the indebtedness level, number one. Number two, of the total\ncustomers that we have, we have split the customers' indebtedness across the MFI levels, and\nwe've presented it in the slide for all of you to see.\nThe last point in this, I would mention is with tighter control on credit and sharper monitoring,\nWe expect to see an improvement in the portfolio quality. So we believe these challenges are\ntransitory in nature and operations should normalize within the next 3 to 4 months. We have not\ncome across any structural changes, be it in terms of rural demand, be it in terms of dip in income\nlevels or macroeconomic outlook and hence, have reasons to believe that the normalization\nshould happen during the period.\nWith this, let me move to the regular updates for the quarter. During the quarter, we got 2\nupgrades from the existing rating agencies. The first was India Ratings, which upgraded us to\nA+ Stable from A Stable. Then we had ICRA, which upgraded us to A+ Stable from, again, A\nPositive. This was on top of A+ rating from CARE, which was a new rating, which we had\nannounced last quarter.\nMeanwhile, on business front, let me start with update on the 2 new businesses we had launched\nmid of last year in our subsidiary, which is Criss Financial Limited. LAP and Nano loans. The\nnew book that we ended within the quarter was INR88 crores. In fact, happy to inform everyone\nthat we've crossed INR100 crores a couple of days back, which is a new book on secured and\nabout 20%, 25% of the unsecured loans to retailers. But predominantly, it is a book which is\nbiased on secured lending.\nThe book is delivering a yield of 23.75%. While a small portfolio yet, however, is delivering the\ncollection efficiency of almost 100%.\nOn the business drivers, let me just quickly go through. Our disbursement for the quarter was\nINR2,283 crores, which was a growth of 37% Y-o-Y over last year. Q1 is usually a lean quarter\nfor microfinance industry and hence, our quarter-on-quarter disbursement declined by 42%.\nHowever, a Y-o-Y at least -- while the numbers are there, but we do not see any weakening\ndemand. We ourselves tone down the disbursement because we felt it is very important that we\nensure that the quality is restored in the branches.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nAUM at the end of quarter 1 was INR11,723 crores, which was a growth of 72% Y-o-Y.\nCustomer acquisition continues to be our focus. We acquired about 200,000 customers during\nthe quarter. For now, as I have covered, I'm just repeating, for now, we have stopped lending to\nnew to credit borrowers. It's not that -- and I'll cover it in the question-and-answer session. But\nwe've taken this practical step. Once things normalize, we'll kind of pick it up. Our LAP and\nNano business under our subsidiary Criss Financial is growing steadily.\nAs I have already told you, no, we crossed INR100 crores a couple of days back. We have\nambitious plans for this enterprise and this franchise, and we are going on track. We expect these\n2 lines of business to scale up to about INR500 crores by end of the current financial year.\nOn the portfolio quality for the microfinance business, we continue to maintain provisioning at\n80%. The quarter saw GNPA increase to 2.6% from 1.63% a year ago, which is an increase of\nabout 97 bps. Sequentially, GNPA increased by 109 bps, which was reported end of March.\nLikewise, our NNPA for the quarter was 0.53%, up 4 bps over what was reported in the last\nquarter.\nOn the liability and marginal cost of borrowings, while we've given exhaustive slides, just\ncovering the high level, we borrowed about INR1,554 crores, which was almost equivalent to\nwhat we borrowed last year in the same quarter. Sequentially, our borrowing was lower by 55%,\nand this is largely because of the seasonality of our business. Our marginal cost of borrowing\nfor the quarter was 11.4%, which was 87 bps lower than 12.27% for last quarter and 50 bps\nlower than 11.9% reported for quarter 4.\nLikewise, if I look at the borrowing mix, we now have a more healthy mix with bank's\ncontribution increasing to 59% at the end of quarter 1. We intend to optimize our borrowing mix\nwith banks contributing about 60% to 70%, so as to place us in a good position at the cost of\nborrowing fund.\nOn the financial performance side, the net interest income for the quarter increased 47% YoY to\nINR425 crores. The PPOP for the quarter was INR287 crores versus INR189 crores of the same\nquarter last year, this was up 52%.\nYield on the portfolio continues to be strong. It was up 35 bps Y-o-Y to 24.4%. NIM for the\nquarter was 15.2%, which is up 91 bps Y-o-Y and 58 bps quarter-on-quarter. NIMs improved as\na result of lower cost of borrowing. We are working on means to pass on the benefits of\nimprovement to the respective stakeholders, which includes the customers.\nOn the PBT and PAT higher provisions going to the transitionary challenges experienced during\nthe quarter resulted in 53% Y-o-Y decline in the PBT to INR75 crores. PAT for the quarter was\nINR56 crores, which was a drop of 53% Y-o-Y.\nGiven the temporary disruption, we expect to close the financial year with an AUM of around\nINR14,000 crores, and with a slightly elevated credit costs that we've been speaking about, we\ncould end of the year, have a credit cost in the range of about 3.75% for the full year.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nSince the situation is evolving, we will revisit the numbers end of quarter 2. To sum up, we\nbelieve these challenges to be temporary in nature and expect operations to normalize in the\nsecond half of the current year. We have taken a number of steps to improve portfolio quality,\nwhich should help us course correct in the current quarter. We will be prudent in our approach\nto lending, ensuring that our portfolio is well diversified, while staying conservative on ticket\nsizes and customer indebtedness.\nThe entire management team of Spandana is thankful for the consistent feedback that we have\nbeen receiving from all of you. We continue to focus on delivering on targets, which we set for\nourselves and look forward to your continued support.\nSo thank you very much. That was the script that I had. Happy to open this up for questions, so\nthat we could answer all of whatever you would want to ask.\nModerator: Thank you very much. The first question is from the line of Renish from ICICI Bank. Please go\nahead.\nRenish: Hi sir, know this has been a tough quarter, but just 2, 3 questions from my side. So sir, one on\nthis entire Project Parivartan. Though in numbers, it looks like it is progressing well, especially\nwhen we look at the collection efficiency at 98% in weekly branches versus 92% maybe in\nmonthly branches. But again, when we look at the another data point, the 65% of the GNPA\nbeing contributed by the Parivartan branches. So what is the disconnect here? I mean, though it\none end collection is significantly better. And on the other end, a large part of Gross NPAs is\nstill sort of contributed by the Parivartan?\nAshish Damani: This is Ashish. I'll just take this and then maybe Shalabh can also add. Typically, the Parivartan\nbranches, I think the right way to look at Parivartan branches is, these branches are not very\ndifferent from non-Parivartan branches at this point in time, because what we did in the\nParivartan branches was only change the date to a day. We have not yet initiated the weekly\nloans in these branches.\nSo logically, all the issues which happened in the country, like we have explained in our script,\nwhether it was heat wave or for that matter, the disruption in the center meeting because of lack\nof availability of, let's say, either the staff or the customers during the elections or because of the\nheat wave, kind of resulted into a lack of on-time collection, so to say. So there has been a\ndisruption. There have been flows.\nIn fact, if I have to look at the collection efficiency across the 2, there will be hardly any\ndifference at this point in time between the non-Parivartan and Parivartan branches. So what we\nare trying to explain is, yes, Parivartan branches is something that was initiated earlier. But\ntoday, I think it is more about bringing the structural discipline across the branches in terms of\nwhatever we have seen.\nAnd the five states that we have mentioned, have a larger impact. And once we correct things in\nthese five states, either by, let's say, balancing the load at a Branch Manager level staff by giving\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\none more credit guy, or by creating a bench for all the attrition that we have seen, which disrupted\nthe kind of center meetings, or by giving them a little bit of relief from customer acquisition or\ndisbursement, just letting them focus on bringing the customer back into the center meeting and\norganizing those center meetings will be the focus for these branches, including the Parivartan\nbranches should -- correct things on an overall basis. So Parivartan, yes, was a concern in the\npast, but today across the board, I think we are going to focus on these pieces.\nShalabh Saxena: Renish, let me just supplement what Ashish said. The Parivartan branches gap between the\nParivartan and non-Parivartan now is practically very slim now. So which is what if you\nremember about two quarters back, three quarters back, we had said that by end of quarter 1,\nmid of quarter 2, I think we should have normalized, which I think, barring very small bps, some\n50 bps, 60 bps, I think both the branches are at par.\nThe point Ashish is making is the disruption has happened everywhere. So that aside, let me also\nremember, and this is a number that I had said when I think in the quarter 2 call of last year. The\nproblem with Parivartan, whatever historical legacy problem has now flown into the GNPA\nbucket.\nSo 48% of the portfolio was the Parivartan branch portfolio, which is contributing to 65% of the\nGNPA. So yes, it was not accepted the way it should have been. Even though it was with the\nbest of intent, but it didn't work. So that is the reality and the numbers are showing.\nHaving said which now it is practically Parivartan, non-Parivartan is all the same. It doesn't\nmatter. The numbers have regularized. Right now, what we are doing is to ensure that across the\n1,500-1,600 branches, we regularized the disruption and normalize the disruption that had\nhappened. So we've moved on from Parivartan and we are on to normalizing the disruption. The\nnumbers that you see are the inherited legacy of whatever we had launched. So that's the\nsupplement to what Ashish just mentioned.\nRenish Bhuva: just to elaborate a bit on that. So let's say the Project Parivartan was all about moving from a\nmonthly to weekly collection model, right? But when we look at it in the PPT, only 400 branches\nare on weekly collection? When we are saying that we are behind the Project Parivartan, still\nI'm not able to connect the dots over here, sir?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So let me explain. When I made that statement that we are behind, what I meant was that\nthis whole differential and the fact that the flows are because of Parivartan, I was specifically\nmentioning about that. Now the original Project Parivartan, which continues to be, and we will\ndrive that, was to convert the monthly to a weekly. We are still on it. In fact, this is the same\nquestion which was asked by somebody in the last call.\nWe continue to maintain that weekly is a good model. The only difference is that instead of the\n48% of portfolio, which we attempted to convert into Parivartan, we will now go slow, step-by-\nstep, center by center, branch by branch district by district. And any new loan which is given,\nwe will encourage the customer to move to a weekly. This is what was our plan. This continues\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nto be our plan. We have not moved away from weekly into monthly, because we are very sure\nand we are convinced that weekly is a model to go. It is just that we will not really implement it\nat a wholesale level. We will go one step at a time. So instead of a 3 months, 6 months, it could\nprobably take 1 year, 1.5 years. So be it. But obviously, at this stage, we cannot, hazard a\nwholesale conversion from a monthly to weekly. We will do it at a loan by level, center by\ncenter, branch by branch.\nAshish Damani: I'm just trying to sum up. Yes, Parivartan branches had challenges or whatever. But right now,\nthe challenges are across the Board in all branches and that is what we're trying to fix. And in\nthe meantime, yes, Parivartan branches will not be done at that scale, but like Shalabh was\nexplaining, on a smaller set, we will continue to approach. Because weekly, overall, if you would\nhave seen our numbers, we have also given weekly branches in the INR1,400 crores portfolio's\nperformance is at 98% collection efficiency compared to 94% on an overall basis.\nSo clearly, weekly model is much superior to the monthly model. And we continue to believe\nthat, and experience shows that.\nShalabh Saxena: So on a cadence basis, if you see, 25% of our disbursement is weekly. On an AUM basis,\nobviously, AUM operates at a lag, it is about 15%. So this will continue, Renish. And in parallel,\nwe will start moving the customers on weekly. However, not straight away at a wholesale 48%\nor 50% type of a portfolio, we will move center by center, branch by branch, so that things\nremain under control.\nRenish Bhuva: Got it. And sir, just lastly, on the cost of fund and the credit cost part. So when we look at the\nmargins, which is at 15%, and if we believe what is there in the media, etcetera, wherein RBI is\nstill behind the companies for passing on the benefit. So do you foresee any risk to the 15%\nNIM? And hence any risk to the ROA after factoring a higher credit cost at 3.75%?\nAshish Damani: So Renish, 15% NIM is anyways a much higher number than what we have kind of\ncommunicated or guided for. We would like to be around the 14% number, 13.5% to 14%. And\nwe have passed some benefits to the customers in April, starting April 1, where we have reduced\n1% for customers who are in 6 cycle and above. And we keep reviewing this. This quarter from\na cost of borrowing perspective has been very good for the organization at 10.7% in terms of\nmarginal cost.\nHowever, this is also something to do with the fact that we have done a lot many more PTC\ntransactions. When you do some other kinds of borrowings, probably the cost may be slightly\ninching up in the coming quarters. It will be in between whatever we have seen last year and\nwhat we have seen for the quarter. And accordingly, whatever we feel that there is a benefit that\ncan be passed back to the customer. We'll keep deliberating on that.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Renish, let me just supplement what Ashish said. There are two vectors of the two\nvariables that we're working on. First is the absolute cost and the borrowing cost, which is a\nfactor of the mix that we operate, number one. Number two, whatever is the optimization that\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nyou get out of the mix or even otherwise, because we've got now two upgrades and one fresh\nrating, which is A+ Stable. So obviously, some of the impact will kick in by moving the cost of\nborrowings south.\nIf that happens, as I said in my opening remarks also, we will kind of attempt to pass it on to the\ncustomers, which is the first step that we've already taken. We will continue to evaluate that\nposition so as to ensure that we remain fair to the customers at every given point in time.\nOur stated position on NIMs has been that we will operate in a range of about 14,-14.25\nanywhere around that range. You could see one quarter is not a reflection of either a good or\nbad. It is more a consistency which we are kind of wanting to deliver. With this, we'll keep on\nevaluating, and obviously, evaluation happens once we see a stability in the movement across\ntwo, three quarters. So that's how we would position ourselves when it comes to the NIM and\nthe lending rates.\nRenish Bhuva: Alright Sir, just last thing from my side on this collection efficiency or maybe stress at the\nindustry level. If I were to just keep aside this project Parivartan and then when you look at the\ncredit behaviour, etcetera, at the ground level, it is fair to assume that the July collection or the\nJuly trend is better than April, May and June?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So trajectory wise correct, and it will keep on improving is my belief, which is what we are\ngetting to know from when we speak to our people on the ground.\nRenish Bhuva: Okay. So there is no further stress build up, right? I mean keeping aside the Project Parivartan\nat all?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Project Parivartan also, I gave a very elaborate answer. So I think we've moved on, and\nwe will adjust on regularizing everything because we've had a year of Project Parivartan. Now\neverything is regularized, including the numbers. It is just the legacy, which is kind of flowing\nin, which we have to accept and move on.\nWith respect to your specific question on the stress, we've laid out the indebtedness levels in the\npresentations that we've given. We are in a reasonably -- and I speak for our company, we are in\na reasonable position. And as far as the customer indebtedness is concerned, in fact, we are in a\nbetter position. And most importantly, to your last question, are we seeing any specific stress in\na specific geography, the answer is no.\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Aviral Jain from SG India.\nAviral Jain I just want to understand that heat waves and general elections basically got over by 10th June.\nSo are you seeing some signs of improvement in terms of collection efficiency across branches\npost that period, because we have past 6 weeks after that? And it's quite concerning to know that\nthere is increased attrition in 4 or 5 key geographies. What were some of the reasons for that?\nAnd how would you correct it structurally, because that is specific to the company and not\nspecific to the environment?\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nAshish Damani: Aviral, thanks for the questions. I will just take the collection efficiency piece and then let\nShalabh kind of respond to the attrition one. I think this entire collection efficiency piece, yes,\nthere have been green shoots, which we have seen during the month of July. So things have\ndefinitely started improving. Heat wave and all definitely reduced the participation from the\ncustomers, combined with the elections which were going on at that time. We have rolled out\nmany branches in Northern India, where the heat wave was even more strenuous. And that's\nprobably seen in the numbers in the June quarter. But definitely, as we move forward, things\nwill start improving. July has been -- there has been green shoots. I would say there is still scope\nfor a lot of improvement, which we will start seeing from August onwards.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Aviral, let me answer the second part, and it's a very pertinent question, because it's a\ncompany-focused thing. Let me take a step back. Historically, when I see Spandana's attrition\nrates across the loan officer and branch manager level, we've always been doing slightly better\nthan the industry. Our annualized attrition last year, for example, at a Branch Manager level was\n2% per month, roughly about 24% for Spandana. At a LO level, Loan Officer level, we were at\nroughly about 38% to 40% when it comes to loan officer level.\nSo this has been the historical trend. There have been always some spikes here and there in\nstates, but never a convergence into a particular quarter. So this particular quarter, we had these\nfive states, which we've articulated in the slide number three, where we've said that compared to\nour standards itself, while everywhere, there was a bit of an elevated attrition, but these five\nstates kind of had almost, if not double, slightly less than double was the attrition rate.\nThe reasons are as follows. The first is we were reasonably strong in these states. So there was\nan attrition because of an opportunity, because the market presents itself with opportunities.\nThat's number one. Number two, we like it or not, but there is some bit of an additional workload,\nwhich a Branch Manager has to go through, more so from a structure point of view, because in\nour branch, we had a Branch Manager and a Loan Officer.\nThat is why what we have immediately done is that we've put, as I mentioned in my opening\nremarks, in 20% of the branches, the branches which were big had a pause and a customer\nstrength level, we've added people. We've given support to the branch managers so that he is\nable to focus on the other things and not -- because right now, the administrative and the\nsupervisory responsibility is with them. So that's what we've done immediately in the 20% of\nthe branches as we speak. We already have people positioned.\nWe've said that by September end, we will have 50% of the branches have these additional\nsupport. So this will give some respite to the branch manager. The last one is, obviously, what\nwe have done is at just a branch manager is not going to solve the problem. So we've already\nstarted putting people and creating an additional bench of 20% at every of the critical branches,\nwhich is almost about 70%, 75% branches, where we'll have additional bench strength of about\n20% additional. So that if there is an attrition at a loan officer level also, we are able to address\nthat.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nThis is apart from the other engagement activities, recognitions, etcetera, that we are continuing\nto pursue and will continue to strengthen. So point is valid, these five states bore the brunt of the\nhigher exodus. But we've taken the corrective measures and corrective steps the moment we\nkind of saw the data in the first couple of months itself. And I think the last month, which is\nJuly, while we're still not out of July, but we are seeing -- I mean, between July and August, I\nthink we should be normalized on the attrition front. As an institution, we take pride in the fact\nthat we've been able to hold on to our resources for the past 2 years. This was an aberration and\nit should be looked at in that light.\nAviral Jain: My final question, I'll dwell on these credit costs, you had mentioned that this year as of things\nthat we see today, you are envisaging a 3.75% sort of a credit cost. Does that mean that there is\nfurther slippages that you are envisaging?\nYes, we are at 80% PCR already. So any further incremental credit cost has to be driven by fresh\nslippage, which again looks -- if the business has come back to normalcy from a fresh slippages\nstandpoint, it's a very high number compared to the past 7, 8 quarters?\nAshish Damani: Yes, that's pretty accurate. It has been a higher number compared to the last 7, 8 quarters.\nProbably, we will see this kind of stabilizing towards August and September. And from Q3, Q4\nonwards, it's should completely be BAU, that's the expectation. So credit cost in that light in the\nremarks kind of Shalabh alluded to that we are likely to be around the 3.75% number for full\nyear. Definitely, this is much higher than what we envisaged. In fact, our guidance was more\nlike 2.5% when we had our call last quarter. But basis what we have seen in the first quarter,\nprobably we are...\nShalabh Saxena: So Aviral, what happens is that on a distribution of 14,000 employees, INR12,000 crores across\n1,600 branches and about 3.4 million customers, when you have this kind of an impact, it will\ntake at least one additional quarter to kind of come back to normalcy because what you could do\nis to reinitiate the entire effort of reaching out to the customers and trying to clear off whatever\nwent through the earlier buckets. So we will take about a quarter more, which is this quarter is\nwhat I'm saying, just to clarify.\nAnd I think Q3, Q4, and that's what we've said also in H2, we believe will be normal. We will\nsee some elevated costs because the flows are there, we are still managing. But a normalcy\nshould be restored by end of this quarter. We will need at least those 4, 5 months of period to\nkind of come out of it.\nAviral Jain: Yes, that I know that is completely fair. My question was that would you see more incremental\nand 30+ plus addition over this time. Finally come back normalcy in the next 3, 4 months?\nBecause ultimately, I'm saying, the credit cost would be defined by how much provision\ncoverage you need for each of the buckets?\nAshish Damani: Yes. So the credit cost for the full year, as Shalabh mentioned, was probably around 3.75%.\nThere are going to be a little bit more flows in the coming quarters. But there is likely to be\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nimprovement in the 30 to 90 bucket where we have almost INR160 crores of provision setting\nright now. So clearly, it will be a bit of slippages, but some bit of upgrades as well when we are\ngiving out number.\nAviral Jain: Okay. Let's see. Maybe at the end of second quarter, we'll have clarity as to what was the fact\nand my point was that sir, just to complete, what I was saying was this looks like a temporary\nphenomenon given multiple factors, but some of the credit costs could get reversed. I am being\nslightly optimistic, again, on ground situation we'll kind of say, but this would be temporary in\nnature?\nShalabh Saxena: Absolutely. And that's our belief because see, there's inherently nothing wrong with the\ncustomers. See one should be worried when you see a spike in the so-called not-so-good\ncustomers, which doesn't look like. The issue with this whole model here is that if a customer\nslips, you have to work doubly hard to ensure and work with the customer to ensure you recover\nand ensure that she backflows her SMA bucket moves in the reverse, which is where the\nchallenge comes.\nThere's nothing inherently wrong in the customer in our belief. In the process here, something\nwill flow. But as long as you are able to squeeze the fresh flows from a standard into SMA\nbucket, I think another 2, 3 months, we should be fine. And we believe that that's what the belief\nof the team that while this quarter could see some more flows, obviously, but not to the extent\nof whatonewould believe. So that's the reason when I said the 3.75, that was the number that we\nsaid. And then Q3, Q4, I think we completely should be fine.\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Ajay Modi from Piper Serica PMS.\nAjay Modi: Quickly, Shalabh, while on the last questions, the response kind of feels like this is actually\ntransitory. I would like to kind of rephrase and ask this once again. The slippages in 30 to 60\nand 60 to 90 buckets have been very sharp. I mean, 0.92% to 1.68% Q-o-Q and 0.64% to 1.47%\nQ-on-Q. And this is at a time when we've been reading about sudden telling the industry\nparticipants to go slow on -- or stop exposure to borrowers with more than 2 lakh of exposure,\nplus the industry kind of talking about setting up a so-called support fund of INR500 crores. And\nat a time when there is loan waiver already kind of starting from states like Telangana. So does\nit get worse in Q2, Q3 before it kind of actually starts settling down?\nShalabh Saxena: No. So Ajay, I think if you go to our investor deck, slide five, we have put out our customers'\ncohorts across the various indebtedness level. If you see, only 0.7% of our borrowers are more\nthan INR2,00,000. Rest everything is -- about half of them are under INR50,000, which goes\nback to point, and it has nothing to do with this specific quarter. For the last nine quarters, we've\nbeen stressing on three, four things, Ajay.\nThe first is that we, as a company, we measure and focus and monitor customer indebtedness,\nnumber one. We believe that the ticket size is not a game to play. our maximum ticket size on\nour loan is INR80,000, no more.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nProbably this would be the lowest in the industry, but then we are okay with that number two.\nNumber three, Ajay, and this I did not mention in my earnings call, nor is it there on the slide.\nThe rejection rate as a result of theFOIR , which is in existence at this point in time, our company\nrejection rates are 51%. So what I source, I say no to half of them because of the so-called\nindebtedness. And that goes back to, once again, the shorter tenure loans that we've been\npropagating all along.\nWhile our maximum tenor on the loan is 24 months. And we put out in our slide, on the monthly\nloans, we are 12%, 86% is a 24 months, rest everything is about 14% is 12 and 18 months. If\nyou see the weekly loans, we are 68%, 12 and 18 months loan, and we have just about 32%, 24\nmonths loan. So the philosophy of lending short, lending muted ticket sizes, focusing on\nindebtedness is what we are focused on, and we've put up the numbers that you alluded to, right\nhere up front. So this is our spread.\nAnd hence, back to the previous question, which was answered, our confidence on the customers\nfrom an indebted point of view is high. If there are -- there could be other issues, there could be\nother reasons. But over leveraging, etcetera, does not -- at least the data doesn't suggest, nor does\nour interaction with the customers suggest. So that's the, sorry, long answer to your question,\nbut that's our belief.\nAjay Modi: Okay. So I have seen the slide that you are mentioning to. And my question was more, and I am\njust trying to understand more from an industry standpoint, while definitely for you about 48%\nborrowers are below INR50,000. So that's very good as an industry number. What I'm simply\ntrying to understand is, from a microfinance industry standpoint, is there a stress building up in\nthe overall industry that we may kind of see in the coming quarters, or was Q1 more of largely\ntaken the impact?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Q1, my personal belief and having looked at multiple data points, I personally do not\nbelieve there is a systemic over-leverage issue across the industry. I firmly believe that. There\ncould be a few pockets, a few institutions here and there. But my sense is -- forget Spandana,\nmy sense is that it will at best to be in a single digit, cannot be more. So that's number one.\nNumber two is when it comes to the industry, what are the issues the industry is facing today?\nThe industry has to look at, and it is true of us as well. We have to ensure that we look at attrition\nacross the levels, particularly at the branch level for the widespread distribution that we have.\nSo attrition is something that one should be looking at.\nAnd the controls and supervision to ensure that the instances of misappropriation / frauds are\nreduced, so these are the three things that one should be looking at. My personal opinion is that\ninstead of over-leverage, I think these are the two things every company should be looking at,\nand I'm sure every company is looking at.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nAjay Modi: Okay. One quick support question here. So the minus 1 credit officer that you've instituted in\n20% of your branches, can you give a little bit of profile of these officers, just for an\nunderstanding perspective?\nShalabh Saxena: We lost you for the first five seconds. So we picked you up from the minus 1, so if you could\nrepeat the first one.\nAjay Modi: I was just asking the credit level resources that you put in 20%, I'd say the minus 1 to the branch\nmanagers. Can you just share a little bit of profile of these officers?\nShalabh Saxena: So these officers, so our criteria is that they should have -- so we have a performance criteria,\nwe have a vintage criteria, and we are picking people from our company, people who've been\nwith us for more than two years, vintage with us, number one. Number two, as loan officer\nShalabh Saxena: So what we do is to ensure that there is a cultural synergy, the minus 1 profile is somebody who's\nworked with us for two yearsas a loan officer obviously, number one. Number two, he should\nhave delivered some performance criteria standards that we put in. Number three, we ensure that\nthere shouldn't be any -- from a discipline and conduct point of view, he should be completely\nabove board.\nSo, they go through our assessment process because there are quite a lot of eligible candidates\naround, they go through a process and then they are posted as a minus 1 to the branch manager.\nObviously, this is a bench for the branch manager. After a year, they become eligible for a branch\nmanager promotion.\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Rajiv Mehta from YES Securities.\nRajiv Mehta: Just a couple of questions. Firstly, if you can share what is the PAR of 1 to 30 bucket? And\nfollow-up is what can be done from collections to strengthening point of view to stop the forward\nflow or at least stem the forward flow of already delinquent customers who are in 30-60, 60-90\nbucket?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Rajiv, as I mentioned, we've kind of increased the -- we've increased the bench strength\nat a branch level, as I mentioned, 20% additional manpower has been put in. Our experience is\nthat once a customer flows, all it needs is persuasive efforts to ensure you're engaged with the\ncustomer for, one, the same month collection. And the second one is the additional one, which\nshe would have missed out.\nSo this micro monitoring at a customer level is what each of these branches are exposed to and\neach of these branches are being guided to. In the first phase, we have about 822 branches where\nwe put up these additional resources who are along with the branch manager and the credit\nofficer wherever the person has been appointed, together they go and they kind of monitor and\nthey engage with the customer to ensure that there's a sufficient traction built for the reverse.\nThat's number one.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nNumber two is, Rajiv, what we are also doing is to ensure that the fresh sourcing that we do is\nonly under control and hence the job description of the minus 1 resource is just to ensure that\nthe profile and the quality of the customer is very well understood. We have a chat with the\ncustomer. This is outside of the loan officer and the branch manager who would have already\nengaged with the customer, do all the quality checks before the customers -- before the proposal\nis pushed for disbursal.\nSo we are not in a hurry to disburse. We are taking our time to ensure that it passes through all\nthe quality checks before a loan is done. So this is on both the earlier collection as well as the\nfresh proposal. To your question on the 1 to 30, it’s typical. If you see the past trends also, it is\n1 to 30 equivalent to your 31 to 90. So at this point in time, it is 3.1%, 3.2%.\nRajiv Mehta: Is this the whole -- is this the part 1 to 30 or...?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, 1 to 30.\nRajiv Mehta: Okay. And see, we have stopped acquisition of new to credit customers in certain branches,\nmaybe post a new member acquisition in 14% branches. The new center addition has been\nrestricted in 39% of branches. So what will make us lift these restrictions because at some point\nin time, you will start to even grow in these impacted locations. So is there any benchmarking\nin terms of say, the general parameters like collection efficiency or the PAR being brought down\nto a certain level, post which we will more open up in terms of customer acquisition and growth?\nShalabh Saxena: Absolutely. So Rajiv, we have -- for each of the elements that have been put out on the slides,\nwe have our internal benchmark, which we put up where we will start opening up the gates. At\nthis point in time, our belief is getting the portfolio back in control is very important. And hence,\nwe've taken all those steps. Internally, yes, for each of the branches have been given a mandate\nthat you cross this milestone, this gate opens. You cross another milestone, this gate opens.\nAcross the branches, what we have definitely not done is to not stop loans to the existing\nmembers who are paying well. Obviously, that channel remains open. But otherwise, for every\nsingle of the milestones that have been put up, which includes center addition, which is at this\npoint in time applicable to about 510-odd branches, the member acquisition has been paused in\nabout 223 branches and so on and so forth. So every single branch has a milestone to cross and\nthen they kind of move up the ladder.\nRajiv Mehta: Just one last thing on this INR2,300 crores disbursement, which we did in this quarter. So I'm\nsure this has been a much lesser impacted or kind of relatively much, much better markets than\nwe would have disbursed. So can you maybe call out which are the better markets at this point\nin time, which are performing better versus the problems what you see in some of the impacted\nmarkets?\nShalabh Saxena: So the five states that we've already put out, Rajiv, those are the five states which have borne\nthe brunt of whatever has been the quality interruption. I think outside of that, we personally\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\ndon't believe that -- I mean the numbers don't tell any different story from what we put out in\nthe slides.\nSo these are the five states where we are -- I mean there is a differential of about -- if my memory\nserves right about 300 bps between these five states and the non-five states. So overall, once if\nwe are able to correct and we are -in these five states regularized, I think we should be good.\nRajiv Mehta: Sorry, just one clarification. You said 300 bps difference in collection efficiency?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So overall quality matrix -- collection efficiency is the first, because GNPA has gone, we\ncan’t do anything about it. But we measure various -- we see the flow rates. We see the early\ndelinquencies and so on and so forth. All of that, if I combine, there is that bit of a difference\nbetween these five states and the non-five states.\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Shreepal Doshi from Equirus Securities.\nShreepal Doshi: So the question was pertaining to this high attrition. So this seems pretty sudden in nature. So\nhave we looked at what are the reasons? Is it the entry of a number of new lenders in these states,\nor what is it like? Because this sort of an attrition looks pretty sharp. I mean, maybe the zonal or\nregional managers would have got some hint of this sort of event. So just if you can elaborate\non this?\nShalabh Saxena: So for the specific, Shreepal, the point you are making on terms of entry is for the state of\nTelangana. That is the only state where others are not there and they are coming. So is there an\nimpact? We have some INR320 crores of portfolio across the INR12,000 crores in Telangana.\nSo is that one reason? So I'm saying, see, it is not about whether you -- and the attrition is in\nstates where everybody or the other people have been around, the competition has been around.\nOur personal experience is that microfinance to microfinance, people attriting into another\nmicrofinance company is a small portion of the attrition. People tend to kind of go out of the\nindustry because there are enough opportunities that exist. So specifically, and we've done a lot\nof analysis for all the employees who've gone across not just these five states, but across all the\nstates that we operate. There isn't a specific trend of some 50% people moving into another\nmicrofinance company. It's a small portion. It is a portion, but it is definitely not a large portion\nworth measuring.\nWhat gets to the people is the general fatigue having worked for long in microfinance, the\nstrenuous nature and the drill that goes into this. So every person takes every pressure differently.\nAnd if it is a sustained pressure over the years, then people react differently. And I agree with\nyou, these five states only in this quarter. So nothing has -- I mean the only thing that we can\nand we've done, we spoke to all of them after they had exited and all of them.\nIt's a combined nature of staying away from the family and a lot of hours being put in this apart\nfrom the workload, etcetera, which leads them to sort of move on either in the industry or outside\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nthe industry. But there's no specific one line trend that I can give you an answer saying because\nof this, they left or X company took them or Y company took them.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it. Sir, the other question is little industry-wide. So while speaking with other MFI\nmanagement as well, I mean these are the five, at least Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, MP\ncomes across as common states in terms of asset quality issues. While our reasons are, of course,\nlittle company specific, the other peers have indicated more industry-wide issue, while our\nstance is a little different. So I'm not able to connect the two, because...\nShalabh Saxena: No. So let me clarify. For Spandana, these five states, the flows have been accentuated because\nof the reasons that I have mentioned. Inherently, there are issues in pockets in the states that\nyou've mentioned. So it is not that everything is hunky dory for us and -- but for this they too\nwould have been resolved. That's not the point.\nThe point is that there are challenges and there are challenges in these locations. We were able\nto manage to a large extent, even at that time, if you go back to Q4 and Q3 of last year, not these\n5, but at least 3 states had a slightly elevated deterioration, if I may call so, in the -- compared\nto the rest of the country.\nWhat we are trying to say is that the reason these five states, the number has been accentuated\nbecause of the experienced branch manager leaving. Obviously, we put the experienced people\nback and we are back to business, and I'm just clarifying that. It's not a stand-alone, it is a 1 plus\n1.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it. Sir, just last question. If you look at the Stage 2 coverage, maybe Ashish sir can also add\nin here. The Stage 2 coverage has seen a very sharp increase from say, 37%, 38% to almost 47%,\n48%. I mean, if you could just elaborate on this?\nAshish Damani: So Shreepal what we did was we have updated the model last quarter, if you recall, and we have\nkind of smoothened the data across the 8-year period in the ECL model and have taken out all\nthe biases, which were running in the model from a, let's say, COVID-perspective or from a\nDemonetisation perspective or any other aberration that was there in the business?\nWe have actually now ignored all of that and let the data only smoothen across the buckets of\nthe periods. What we have done is we've taken monthly data for last 8 years, and that has been\nbuilt into the model as a driver. This kind of led to an increase in the bucket requirements of the\nflows of the PD rates for both Stage 1 and Stage 2 which was implemented last quarter. So this\nquarter, just to clarify thisquarterv, there has not been any change. We have just sticked to the\nmodel as is and whatever has been coming out has been provided for.\nShreepal Doshi: Just one data keeping I think somebody else also asked what is par 1 to 30 bucket a number?\nAshish Damani: 3.2% is 1 to 30 bucket.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it. Thank you so much and good luck for the next quarter.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Abhijit Tibrewal from Motilal Oswal Financial\nServices. Please go ahead.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Based on questions from these 5 specialist individuals who asked questions before me, I mean,\nI'm sure you can very well make out what most of us analysts and investors are trying to\nunderstand is what the MFI sector is going through now is transient in nature, more like\ndisruption from elections or heat waves and will course correct itself in the next 3 to 6 months\nfrom now or is this a credit cycle in the works because of, I mean, reasons which are unexplained\nas of now. You also referred to this leverage which is actively being tracked by all players today.\nSo I had two questions. You have cut your AUM growth guidance for this fiscal year based on\nwhat you saw in 1Q, you've also increased your credit cost guidance to 3.75% versus 2.5% until\nlast quarter. So I mean while a lot of discussion has already happened on this subject, what I'm\ntrying to understand is if we are so confident of things normalizing after, let's say, 3 months from\nnow in the second half of the fiscal year?\nThen, I mean, what was the need for this increase in credit cost guidance? Now why I'm asking\nthis is if you look at this quarter's credit cost almost INR210 crores, maybe around INR5 crores,\nINR6 crores is towards write-offs. Rest of it is towards provisioning on Stage 3 and Stage 2\nloans.\nSo if it was just heat wave, if it was just an election impact where someone could have missed\nan EMI because of operational reasons. And if they start repaying , then your guidance cannot\ngo up, right, because your guidance is going up from 2.5% to 3.75% is because you're expecting\nmore write-offs to come through, not necessarily because of higher provisioning. Had it been\nhigher provisioning, they would actually have got reversed when the asset quality would have\nimproved from collections? So what am I missing here is something I'm trying to understand.\nAshish Damani: I will just take this question and probably Shalabh may add if there is something missed out.\nAbhijit, the right way to look at it is, one, at the industry level, you have said and I think at the\nindustry level, our belief was that the new norm is definitely a base of 2%, which is now hovering\nbetween, let's say, 2% and 2.5%. But given what we have seen in the first quarter like Shalabh\nwas explaining earlier definitely what we have seen in the first quarter in terms of credit cost is\nsomething has been higher than our own estimates.\nAnd this 3.75% is the outcome of what we have seen in the first quarter. There are improvements\nthat we are confident of seeing, but those improvements are likely to play out, let's say, in the\nnext 3 to 4 months. So in the interim, there are likely to be some flows. And probably we have\ntaken into account those flows and improvements also subsequently, and that's how the\nguidance.\nI think in the initial narrative that Shalabh gave, he also talked about there has been a little bit of\nreduction in our overall business numbers for the year. And that probably will give you some\nincrease on a percentage terms basis. So these are the factors which are at play, and that's how\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nwe have kind of changed the course on the guidance. However, we have also said that this is an\nevolving situation. We are looking at this. And if, let's say, the improvement is much more, then\nwe will obviously come back and keep discussing these numbers or the outlook going forward.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: So I mean, if I understand this correctly, the way we kind of summarize this is that given that\nthis is an evolving situation, if things are better than what you are expecting right now, you will\nmaybe revisit your credit cost guidance. If that were not to happen, then what will happen is,\nafter 3 to 6 months, collections are expected to improve -- but the slippages, which have\nhappened not just in 1Q, but we've been seeing slippages in 3Q and 4Q of the last fiscal year as\nwell. They will reflect in your Stage 2 and Stage 3 and will eventually get written off? Is that\nright understanding in terms of -- if credit costs were to remain at 3.75%?\nAshish Damani: Yes, that's right, because if the customers have already moved into either a GNPA bucket or if\nthe customer is in 60 bucket, the improvement from there is difficult. It will be slow. However,\nthere are recoveries. It's not that the recoveries are zero. Definitely, there are recoveries.\nAnd since the challenges have been more from a, let's say, administrative disruption or because\nof lack of availability in the center meeting and during that time, and it was not the intent of the\ncustomer. We are very hopeful that things will improve. This will not be a normal flow that if it\ngoes down then it goes down it will not be like that. But we don't want to get ahead of ourselves\nand put the numbers out right now, we will see how things will play out. Efforts will be made\n100%. We have already looked at what are the things that are required to fix this on structural\nbasis, and that's what has been articulated in the document, putting in people, strengthening the\nmonitoring staff at the branch level.\nLooking at how can we improve the monitoring at every stage by using technology. For that\nmatter, reducing the workload of the branch from a disbursement standpoint, focus, let them\nfocus more on the portfolio quality and improving the discipline at the center level. These are\nthe things which people will be focusing more, at least for next, let's say, 4 to 5 months. And\nthat would yield results. On either basis, how things will flow move on, we will get to know in\nthe next 2 to 3 months.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. Sir, just 1 last question that I had is -- I mean, you've already answered this partly in prior\nquestions. But what I'm just kind of trying to understand is, I mean, how are the yields still\nimproving for us when you're already seeing broad-based yield moderation in the sector? And\ndespite the significant increase in our Stage 3, why is it that I mean, interest income reversals\nare not visible which should have impacted your interest income and yields?\nAshish Damani: So two things here. One is, I think this is also linked to the last question which Shreepal asked.\nIn Stage 2 itself, we kind of see 50% provisioning that we do. And from 52 moving to 80%\nwould mean additional 30% of reversal or the impact normally when things move into Stage 3.\nBut this is partly the answer. The other part on the yield side is the mix for us has been improving\nover the quarters. We were earlier, if you recall, we have 2-year loans largely. And the loans\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nuntil October of '22 were given at even 22%. From there we moved to 25% in two parts and\nthat's how the yield was improving on overall basis. That is one aspect.\nThe second aspect is whenever we are doing DA transactions as you know the interest income\nwill move from the interest income line into the net gains line item. And that also has an impact\non the ratio. This quarter we had zero DA. I mean if we were to compare it from the previous\nquarter then that definitely has a positive bearing on the yield on the NIMs and things like that.\nThat's why we are saying on a steady-state basis one should look at a NIM of 13.5% to 14%,\nmore like around 14% to be a standard steady-state NIM for us.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. Sir, I think this is useful. Ashish sir, I'll just leave you with a thought. I will connect with\nyou maybe offline, but one thing that I'm not able to comprehend is. I mean we've always said\nthese MFI customers who should never doubt their intention and willingness to repay when we\ncome across a quarter where elections and heat waves bring out operational challenges, where\nmaybe 1 or 2 EMIs could not be collected. But if the willingness and intent of the customer is\nthere, why is it that, I mean, these things should lead to basically write-offs, is something I'm\nnot able to wrap my head around?\nAshish Damani: Certainly, we'll connect on this offline. Abhijit, just one line. The reason we are saying we are\nvery hopeful in terms of improvements is precisely the reason which you have articulated that\nintention is not a problem. It is an administrative disruption that we are dealing with, it's a\ntemporary issue with us at the customer level. And there are other challenges in terms of\naddressing this which we will discuss maybe offline.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Great. Thank you so much and all the very best to you and your team.\nModerator: Ladies and gentlemen due to time constraints, we will just take last two questions. The next\nquestion is from the line of Janavi Bapat from Hara Capital. Please go ahead.\nJanavi Bapat: Hello. I wanted to quickly ask if there is any pattern in attrition in the Parivartan branches versus\nnon-Parivartan branches.\nAshish Damani: So there is no pattern per se in Parivartan versus non-Parivartan. It is more towards the states,\nJahnvi, and that's why we have kind of called out those states where there was a higher attrition.\nJanavi Bapat: Okay. And the last 1 is, since you've provided a good breakup of the indebtedness of the\nborrowers. Is it possible also to provide broadly the income distribution of the borrowers, say\nhow many households are like below 1 lakh or between 1 lakh to 2 lakh, 3 lakh, something on\nthose lines?\nAshish Damani : We will give you this data offline because I don't have it readily available, but largely, these\nnumbers are more that our guys discuss with the customer. I mean this is not a very reliable set\njust I'm trying to say because it is more of a discussion and assessment that is being done by the\nloan officers, and that's how it is being worked out. Having said that, we will give you whatever\nnumbers we have.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 27, 2024\nJanavi Bapat: Got it. Thank you so much.\nModerator: Thank you. The last question is from the line of Sarvesh Gupta from Maximal Capital. Please\ngo ahead.\nSarvesh Gupta: Sir, your performance relative to your peers, it looks like on a much, much weaker set of numbers\noverall. So what can be the reason why we are particularly hit much more than the industry. Of\ncourse, all the players have reported weaker results. But I think your results are probably at the\nbottom percent, 25 percentile. So any specific reason with respect to our policies or our\nmanagement of this entire election season how we have been disproportionately impacted? This\nis something I could not understand.\nShalabh Saxena: So Sarvesh, every company operates a different model, has different way in which it functions\nand has a different environment in which it operates. The numbers are there for everyone to see,\nso nobody can doubt or dispute it. All we know for sure is that for the last 9 quarters, there is a\ncertain set of patterns that we had and we had observed. This one quarter had some disruption,\nprobably as we've kind of very -- in an elaborate way we've articulated the reasons which were\nthe states which kind of dragged the portfolio down. And that's the reason why we've a result,\nwhich is what all you and I see.\nHaving said, which -- what is very critical is that -- what is the profile of the customer? Is the\ndeterioration or is the quality which has gone down south, Is it because of a structural reason?\nIs there something that you are doing, which is very different from what the industry is doing?\nThe answer is no. We have evaluated and which is what I covered in my commentary also, the\nnature, there is no structural difference in the way we operate from the industry. Yes, we have\ncertain norms or certain philosophies in which we operate, which are from credit point of view,\nwhich are more on the conservative side. So if not today, tomorrow, it will show up.\nBut at this point in time, all I would want to say is that the disruption was accentuated by the\nattrition which has led us to where we are. And we'll take a quarter to recover post which then I\nthink things should be BAU.\nModerator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will take that as the last question. I would now like to hand the\nconference over to the management for closing comments.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you very much for joining this call. Thank you for the patience. We took an extra about\n20, 25 minutes of call just to ensure that we are able to communicate what happened during the\nquarter and what is the way ahead for us. For all those who couldn't ask specific questions you\nhave our coordinates, you can get in touch with us and we'll be very happy to kind of provide all\nthe clarifications. Thank you for all the support and thank you for joining the call.\nModerator: On behalf of Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited, that concludes this conference. Thank you\nfor joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines.\n"

Should you need assistance\nduring the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing “*”, then “0” on your touch tone\nphone. Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI now hand the conference over to Mr. Shalabh Saxena – MD and CEO, Spandana Sphoorty\nFinancial Limited. Thank you and over to you, Mr. Saxena.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you very much. Good evening to all of you. Thank you for your interest in our Company\nand for taking time out to join us on this call. Most of you would have gone through our Results\nthat have been uploaded on the Stock Exchanges a couple of hours ago. While the Results are\ndefinitely underwhelming, please allow me to give you a context for these results.\nSo, let me begin with giving you some landscape on the industry, and then we will go into the\nspecifics of the Company.\nOver the past couple of years there have been subtle shifts that have happened in the sector. I will\ntake you through the happenings. Before that, as you are already aware, microfinance and the JLG\nmodel areare the mainstay of our business. Q1 was the first quarter where we saw signs of\nweakness in the environment when the sector was impacted due to the long-drawn elections,\nintense heat waves and the high attrition in a few states. This is what we had covered in our last\ncall when we met up with all of you.\nThe dilution of the JLG model, and when I say dilution, it is obviously not uniform but there has\nbeen a dilution post-COVID. That is taking time to turn around. This has impacted our center\nmeetings, the discipline around the center meetings, and a key indicator of a customer engagement\nbeing center attendance. That is still at 55% odd levels, so 55% to 60%, certain pockets are slightly\nhigher. I am just averaging it out at national level.\nAnother point is that the field attrition level, and this we covered in detail the last time around. The\nfield staff attrition level has been high over the past few quarters. Our understanding, and basis the\ndeep engagement that we have done over the past quarter, quarter and a half with our field staff,\nwhich is both the branch and the supervisory level, there are various reasons, and we will cover it\nin this opening remarks as well as in the subsequent questions, if people would have. There are\nvarious people who react to the various challenges that are there in the market or that exist in the\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nmarket. Our understanding from what we gathered was that most of them prefer to go out of the\nindustry. There isn't a significant percentage which is moving into the industry, so that is what I\nwould want to bring out.\nAnother point is, borrowers with established track record, they graduate or they are graduating to\nnon-MFI loans. While there's nothing wrong in it, it is just that in times like these it puts some bit\nof pressure on the finances of the family, and hence the repayment capability.\nThe last point on this landscape that I would want to highlight is borrower indebtedness, and we\nhave covered this in detail. So, borrower indebtedness is one of the challenges impacting the\nindustry. If we look at the borrower’sborrower’s indebtedness or over leveraging, I am just\nreferring to Slide 6 of the investor presentation. While when we gave the loan we had a particular\nposition, the position over the last two years as per the latest data available has seen a significant\nshift downwards from Spandana and Spandana plus one. The percentage of portfolio has moved\nand shifted downwards, and the numbers are given there.\nWhile you have been listening to us over the past many quarters, we have been maintaining a ticket\nsize of not more than 80,000, irrespective of the vintage, that's the max ticket size that we offer.\nThe tenure of the loans is 24 months, we introduced the 12 and 18. And we obviously keep a close\ntrack of the indebtedness at the customer level. So, the average indebtedness of a borrower with\nSpandana, while it has declined by 13%, however, we operate in an environment and hence we\nhave been impacted there. The details are there in the slides.\nSo, this is the background of the industry and the impact on us. Obviously, we are doing our best\nand the various initiatives that we have taken to ensure that we arrest the situation and we try to\nturn this around. The environment will have to play its part, but we are doing the best that we can\nas a team to ensure that we manage the two, three-clear vectors which are there which is; how you\nlend, how you collect; and most importantly, take care of your people.\nMore recently, the disruption was caused over the past few months in a few geographies due to the\nclimatic factors like heavy rainfall and floods during the 2nd Quarter. The sector has been\nexperiencing influence in the form of localized movements also, which has further compounded\nthe problems. As I mentioned, Spandana has not been immune to any of these challenges.\nDue to attrition over the past few quarters the share of loan officers, and we have highlighted this\nin the presentation as well. The share of loan officers in less than one year tenure at Spandana was\n67%, this has to be looked at in context because we have opened new branches, because our\nbranches which are big, we split those branches as well. So, that tenure has to be looked at in\ncontext. The 67% comparatively used to be about 50% - 51%, just about three, four quarters back.\nSo, there's a bit of a rawness in the team given the fact that we have had the various challenges\nthat I elucidated too.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nOn the branch On the branch manager’smanager’s side, and in the last earnings call we had detailed\nto you. We had taken many steps to ensure that the branch manager attrition is curtailed, which I\nthink we have been reasonably successful. There are regrettable resignations and there are non-\nregrettable resignations. So, of the regrettable ones, we had taken an organization wide initiative\nabout a couple of months back to ensure that we reach out to them. And we have been reasonably\nsuccessful. We were able to retain about 78% of the people who we wanted to retain. So, I think,\nas a headline if I were to say, the branch manager reasonably protected, and we will have to keep\nup and keep monitoring this important vector for the next few quarters.\nThe supervisory layer above the branch manager, we had some challenges, but that was not really\nto the extent where we would be worried, and we have kind of taken care of them as well. This\nquarter and the next quarter areare all about the loan officer and how do we engage with them to\nensure that we have reduced the attrition at the loan officer level.\nHaving considered the external and internal challenges, we had already announced a few measures\nduring our last earnings call. The teams are working hard to normalize the operations. However,\nas a measure of abundant caution, the following additional steps were taken during the 2nd Quarter:\n1. I covered this, prioritizing people – We introduced a few cultural changes in the way\nbusiness is conducted at Spandana, including focus on softer aspects like reward and\nrecognition, team building, increasing employee connect through multiple channels of\ncommunication and meetings, compulsory system shut down hours, leave policy, etc.\nAll of these policies and initiatives were looked at and we have had already implemented\nthem.\n2. Conservative lending approach – As announced earlier, Spandana had paused on-\nboarding new-to-credit borrowers. You would have read the guardrails and the way the\nindustry has kind of joined together to ensure that we bring discipline. As a matter of\nabundant caution, we have announced internally that the organization will not be the\nfourth lender to new-to-Spandana borrowers.borrowers. So, any borrower which is new-\nto-Spandana, we will be the third lender, although the guardrail allows fourth, but to\nbegin with, we are saying that we will be the third lender. So, this is slightly more\nconservative than the guardrails, and we will see as it goes. As things improve and we\nmight change, but at this point in time this is one of the initiatives that we have\nundertaken.\n3. Controls – Strengthening controls is something that we have been working on and\nmicrofinance is all about how well you put a policy in place and how well you monitor.\nSo, on the control side, optimized supervisory span of control and monitoring, further\nstrengthening of KYC checks, additional controls have been put in place to check frauds\netc.\n4. Collection focus – we have classified branches into three sets of branches, growth\nbranches, stable branches and focus, based on parameters like collection efficiency,\nportfolio quality, etc. Based onBased on this qualification we stopped new member\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nacquisition in about 46% of the branches, which are essentially the focus branches.\nSimilarly, we have put restrictions in place to stop adding new centers in 15% of stable\nbranches. So, while customer acquisition is on in these branches, but however new\ncenters we have just put a restriction to that. These restrictions, we believe, will help the\nfield team of these branches to focus solely on ensuring timely collection of dues and\nmeeting the customers’ disbursement requirements as and when they might need.\n5. As announced in the last earnings call, Spandana has created a separate quality assurance\nlayer at branches which will focus on process adherence, quality, customer service, etc.\nThis will help free up the branch manager's bandwidth, allowing him to focus on\nbusiness and control parameters.\n6. To ensure focus stays on collections, additional bench has been added across few\nbranches. AA dedicated collection team has been created, and borrower-to-loan officers\nspan in selectedselected branches has been reduced. This has led to an increase in OpEx\nto AUM for the quarter, as you would have seen. But then these are temporary pains for\na quicker than usual normalization. And we expect cost to income to be about 45% by\nend of the year.\nWe continue to believe that these challenges are transitory in nature and operations should\nnormalize by the end of the current financial year. We have not come across structural changes in\nrural demand or long-term dip in economic activity or macroeconomic outlook or income levels.\nSo, this is very critical. Next few quarters, as far as the Company is concerned, we will drive the\nrigor and discipline of how well and judiciously we lend, and how efficiently we collect. These\nare going to decide the coming quarters, and we as a team are geared up to kind of ensure that we\nrun this in a very well and efficient manner.\nNow, let me move to the regular Business Updates:\nOn the business drivers, owing to challenges alluded to earlier, Spandana was cautious in lending.\nOur disbursement for the quarter was Rs. 1,514 crores, a Y-o-Y decline of 40%. AUM at the end\nof Quarter 2 was Rs. 10,537 crores, registering a growth of 8% Y-o-Y. However, sequentially, the\nAUM declined by about 10%. Right now we are completely focused on ensuring that the stability\non the portfolio quality side comes up sooner than later. And hence, the slowing down of\ndisbursement is a part of the larger strategy that we have, wherein we give more time to the branch\nto reach out to the non-regular customers or the arrear customers. And we collect and get them\nback to a regular mode.\nThe day we are confident that this will happen, which we believe is not very far, the AUM will be\nstepped up. And by the end of the year, we should be slightly more than what we ended the last\nyear with, from AUM point of view. I thought I will just add this before I get into the next point.\nWith pause in the customer acquisition in large number of branches, our total customer acquisition\nfor the quarter was about 80,000 customers.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nIn every earnings call we give you details of our new, new lines of business which areare LAP and\nNano loans. Our LAP and Nano loans business under our subsidiary Criss Financials is growing\nsteadily. This we started about a year ago. We have now scaled the distribution to over 100\nbranches spread across six states, with AUM at the end of Quarter 2 at about Rs. 160 crores. The\nportfolio quality under both these products continues to be strong. We invested last year in setting\nup systems and processes and continue to believe in the strong market potential of these products.\nAt a Company level, we continue to maintain provisioning at 80% in the quarter because of the\nreasons that I alluded to. The quarter saw the GNPA increase to 4.86%. Likewise, our NNPA for\nthe quarter was 0.99%, up 46 bps over 0.53% reported at the end of June ‘24. On the liability and\nmarginal cost of borrowings, including the borrowing mix, during the quarter we borrowed Rs.\n1,584 crores. The reduction in borrowing was due to the cautious disbursement approach that we\nhad adopted as an organization. Our marginal cost of borrowing for the quarter was 11.4%, which\nwas 46 bps lower than Quarter 2 FY ’24 and 61 bps higher over quarter one of FY ‘25. Likewise,\non the borrowing mix, the bank contribution in the total borrowing has increased to 54% at the end\nof Quarter 2 FY ‘25.\nOn Quarter 2 Financial Year ‘25 Financial Performance:\nThe net interest income for the quarter increased 9% Y-o-Y to Rs. 341 crores, over Rs. 312 crores\nreported for Q2 of last year. Net interest income was down 20% over the last quarter. The PPOP\nfor the quarter was Rs. 228 crores, down 12% Y-o-Y, and 21% quarter-on-quarter. Yield on the\nportfolio was down by 202 bps to 22.4%. NIM for the quarter was 12.8%. NIMs declined as a\nresult of decline in yield and an an increase in cost of borrowing. Our efforts are constantly focused\non improving our cost of borrowing. However, the bigger opportunity lies in reversing the portfolio\nquality trend where we will get a lot of releases. For the profit after tax, higher provisioning at the\nend of the quarter has led to a decline in the PAT. And we have reported, as you would have seen,\na loss of Rs. 216 crores.\nWe continue to believe that these challenges are transitory and expect operations to normalize by\nthe end of the current financial year. The steps taken to course-correct will be monitored very\nclosely and all our actions will now be focused on improving the portfolio quality. We will\ncontinue to be prudent in our approach to lending, ensuring that our portfolio is well diversified,\nwhile staying conservative on ticket sizes and customer indebtedness. The entire management team\nof Spandana is thankful for the consistent feedback that we have been receiving from all of you.\nWe look forward to your continued support.\nWe can now open up for questions, operator.\nModerator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from\nthe line of Rajiv Mehta with YES Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nRajiv Mehta: Sir my question is on Stage-2, which has substantially increased. So, when I look at previous\nquarter, the kind of increase we saw in Stage-2 in Q1Q1, and then the flow which came in Q2Q2\nin Stage-3, it seems that the flow rates are significantly high. Almost everything is flowing from\nStage-2 to Stage-3, despite augmented collection effort. So, now that Stage-2 has further increased\nso substantially in Q2, would this assessment be correct that a significant part of it will flow in\nQ3?\nAshish Damani: Hi, Rajiv, this is Ashish this side. If we do simple math, maybe what you are saying adds up. But\nthe right way to look at it is, there has been almost 50% collections happening even in the Stage-\n2 buckets. Although the flows at the top areare what is contributing the flows going below, that\nneeds to stabilize and that's what we are working on.\nShalabh Saxena: Let me just add, Rajiv. The recruitment, we started additional manpower recruitment beginning of\nlast quarter, somewhere around July and August. So, the incremental benefits of all the people that\nwe have recruited and all the people who have been in the branches where we have taken, we will\nsee the incremental benefits only this quarter. That's number one. Number two is, even if, and I\nkind of mathematically obviously agree to you, but for the flows also which have happened,\nadditionally we have a recovery team now. We will not disturb the core of the model which is until\n90 the loan officer handles. Beyond 90, because we still feel we have analyzed Rajiv, the portfolio,\nthe customers who are kind of flowing, who have kind of crossed the buckets. There is no specific\ntrend of a particular quarter sourcing being bad or a particular year sourcing being bad. There is a\nvery clear linearity in the vintage and the contribution of the AUM and the subsequent percentage\nof SMA buckets, SMA customers in those buckets.\nSo, our belief is, for customers who have been with us for four years, five years, six years, it is\nprobably the current disruption in the environment that is leading them to not really honor their\npayments is our belief. So, our recovery team, which has now been set up, we already have some\n300-odd people, and in the next or rather this month and max by mid of next month, we will have\naround 500, 550 people who will approach these customers and we will start the recovery\ninitiatives. Because these customers from an intent point of view areare not an issue, they are all\nold customers with us. So, that should also incrementally play out to our benefit as we progress.\nRajiv Mehta: Got it. And just to understand that, the collection efficiency is now stabilizing or curtailing, if you\ncan get the collection efficiency of the zero DPD bucket and how it is moving between September\nand October, because I think Ashish did point out that the leakages or the slippages are coming\nfrom the top. So, if we want to understand that whether the slippageslippage at the top isis reducing\nnow incrementally, we need to know the zero DPD collection efficiency bucket. I mean, collection\nefficiency and how that is moving incrementally.\nShalabh Saxena: So, I will directionally answer that. October, obviously, will be difficult one to answer here. But\ndirectionally, is there a significant better movement? The answer is no, Rajiv. Are there green\nshoots in certain pockets? The answer is yes. Is there a clear correlation where you put people and\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nit is going to help you? The answer is again yes. And we are seeing some initial green shoots. But\nare the green shoots going to convert into a trend? It is too early for us to say. However, our\nunderstanding of the problem and the pockets that have been impacted and our various\nengagements over the past three months with the teams on the ground, I think we have a reasonable\nsense of the extent of the problem, and the next steps as far as the problems are concerned. That is\nwhy we have kind of recruited the people and put them in places where we have an issue.\nThe second additional point, Rajiv, also is the fact that there is, like it or not, because of the\nenvironmental challenges, most of the people have curtailed. Many companies, or rather\npractically every Company has curtailed their lending, and rightfully so. We are no different. So,\nthis has led to some bit of shortage in the circulation from a customer’scustomer’s working capital\npoint of view. So, we are dealing with all this. Our belief is that the customers’ intent is not a\nproblem, it is just some bit of working capital adjustment that needs to be done on her part. And\nmore engaged we are, the better the chance that we will be regularizing it soon.\nRajiv Mehta: And on this ESOP, I mean, what is the ESOP penetration within the Company? I mean, till what\nlevel have you distributed ESOPs and how many people would be covered, if you can give that\nsome color? And second is, you spoke about that you have been able to retain some of the outgoing\nBMs whom you wanted to retain, so how were they retained? I mean, were their bandwidth got\nreleased and which is why they stayed back, or some other initiatives were taken to retain them?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So, the good part, Rajiv, and it's a very good question because that's exactly our focus.\nBecause we believe that if you have happy people around, the rest is an outcome which can be\ntaken care of. For the specific point that you mentioned on the branch manager, because that is\nwhat we had identified the last time around because that was a problem that could be addressed\nbecause we have some 1,700 or 1,650-odd branch managers. We physically went out to them, the\ndifferent senior people went out to 36 locations and had a physical meeting with them. And that\nled to the turnaround where we were able to retain almost 78% of the branch manager who were\nserving notice. Now, did we offer them anything? The answer is no. Did we give them any other\nbenefit outside of that, that obviously is not correct also, because somebody resigns, you do not\nreally offer them anything which is monetary. All it required us was to have a good discussion and\nunderstanding of what were the issues that they were facing. And clearly there were issues and\nhence they were where they were. So, we were able to come back to them in terms of the action\nsteps, and we have some list of 10, 12 action steps which we had to take, which we have already\nimplemented at an organization level. So, that within a space of about 10 days, we had all of them\npull back their resignations.\nOnce we had our belief, and we continue to believe that if you take care of your branch manager,\nwhich we did the last time around, time our initiatives, now we have already started those\ninitiatives which is to connect at a LO (Loan Officer) level through the branch manager. So, ensure\nthat the branch manager and the supervisory level have their KRAs very well integrated to the\nlarger objective of the organization which is holding back the LOs. Once you hold them, because\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nany native knowledge which goes out of your Company, it takes about two, three months for a\nnew person to really come and then come up to speed. So, overall, I think we are very happy as a\nteam with the way we have kind of dealt with branch managers and above. As an organization\nreaching out to 36 locations across about almost about 2,500 people, which is branch managers\nand above, I think it it was a good step and a timely step which gave us results. I think another\nmonth, month and a half, I think we should be in a a decent position to at least come to a place\nwhere we, apart from the branch manager, we start seeing incremental results on the loan officer\nside as well.\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Shreepal Doshi with Enquirus. Please go ahead.\nShreepal Doshi: Sir my question was, I mean, while a few questions have been answered, but just a data keeping\nquestion. What is our Spandana plus four and unique-to- Spandana customer base?\nShalabh Saxena: You can see that on slide number six, Shreepal, there’s a table at the left hand top.\nShreepal Doshi: Okay, got it, I will go through that then. And, just another question was on this, the rise in PAR\nnumbers, right. So, is it fair to take it this way that the MFIN guardrails have led to an accelerated\nrecognition of stress or the movement of the Stage-1 to Stage-2 and then so forth has been pretty\nsharp?\nShalabh Saxena: So, Shreepal, here is my view. Any step which is taken which is good for the industry, should be\nwelcomed. And I think we have. And I do not know if you picked it up in my commentary, we\nhave said that new-to- Spandana, we are going a step ahead. We will not be the fourth lender, so\neffectively we are stopping at three. So, even if the medicine is bitter we will have to swallow it,\nbut the end result has to be that all of us get well, as an industry. So, that's where I am not looking\nat it one quarter or two months or one month, I am looking to the four quarters, eight quarters. I\nthink it's a step in the right direction. And I think that everybody is going to benefit out of this.\nShreepal Doshi: And then just last question, I think it is part of your commentary as well. You highlighted that\nmuch of the stress will get absorbed or say taken care of during this year itself. So, you think that\nwill be a function of collections improving from say December end and all over? So, otherwise,\ndo you think there will be spill over in the next year as well?\nShalabh Saxena: So, we still have about five months to go before the end of the year. As I mentioned, I think I gave\na lengthy commentary to Rajiv in the previous question. We are seeing some movement in the\nmarket, but it is still not a trend, hence I am hesitating to say anything in terms of, this is going to\nturn around by December or January. However, the last two quarters are the quarters which are\ngood for the industry, number one. Number two, we believe that with all the other initiatives that\nwe have taken, the initiative which the SRO has taken, I think, will ultimately lead to a situation\nwhere I think the environment operates for the right lending more than anything else. So, that's the\nbelief. I mean, it took three months for the position that we are in, we are still giving five months\nfor this to improve. So, I think we are already two quarters down this year where we dealt with\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nthis problem. So, my belief is that attrition stabilizing, environment stabilizing, lending slightly\ncurtailed, customer discipline back, I think we should by end of the year be able to come out of\nthis.\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Renish with ICICI. Please go ahead.\nRenish: Sir, three questions, so we will go one by one. So, sir, if you look at the slide, it is very much\nvisible that we have been prudent lender reflecting four plus lender share at the time of\ndisbursement at around 5%. But eventually it increases to 13%, clearly players are just lending\nwithout proper assessment, maybe leading to leverage. And despite being the conservative lender,\nwe have to pay a price for over leveraging done by others. So, how do you think this can be taken\ncare of going ahead? I mean, do you foresee SRO, regulator or anyone sort of talking about it and\nmaybe they are maybe in discussion stage, whatever, but any insights on this will be very helpful\nsir.\nShalabh Saxena: So, Renish, I partly answered so I will start and then Ashish will add. I completely agree with what\nyou said. With customers who are with us already, we have limited options but to go and keep\npursuing. Somewhere in the commentary I did mention that, for all the customer acquisition that\nwe are going to start doing now, if there is a borrower who is new to Spandana, we will not be the\nfourth, even though the guardrails allow you to be the fourth, we will be only the third. If we are\nthe fourth, then we will regretfully not do the case. So, that is one of the initiatives that we have\ntaken, because, Renish, we have kind of analyzed various data points all these months that we have\nbeen doing. While there could be patchy trends on various theories that you and I would have, but\none of the trends which is unmistakable is the correlation of lenders and the collection\nefficiency/GNPA. The more the number of lenders, clearly there is a higher pool of arrear\ncustomers corresponding to the AUM that you would have. I will give you a data point and Ashish\njust add to this. And five and greater than five lenders areare about 12% in our AUM, 12% - 12.5%\nin our AUM. And these set of customers’ contribution to the arrear bucket, which includes the\nGNPA is about 21%.\nRenish : Including the DPD?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, I took everything into this, arrears as well as GNPA. See, we are discussing quality, portfolio\nquality, be it a flow in GNPA as well. So, this is the point I am just trying to validate the point that\nI made, that the more number of lenders, there's a clear trend that it kind of stresses out the\ncustomer. Because more number of lenders you have to attend as many center meetings and so on\nand so forth. This is also one of the reasons why the center meeting attendance could be low,\nbecause four or five companies and weekly and combination of fortnightly and monthly, I mean,\nit's a bit of a stretch for the customer. So, that's the reason why to answer your question, we have\nkind of made it a policy until things resume back to normalcy.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nWe will continue to not offer new-to-credit customers a loan because I had covered this in detail\nlast time around because there's too much of operational time which goes and there are other things\nas well which influence this, that's number one. Number two is on this four and more than four. If\nit is an existing customer of Spandana, then obviously she has to be regular, and then we will see\nif she applies for another loan we will evaluate. But if it is a new-to- Spandana customer, then we\nare stopping one short of what is agreed upon by everybody, which is we will not be the fourth\nlender, we will stop at three.\nAshish Damani: The hygiene will get built overtime, Renish, because the SRO's have already come out with this\nguardrail. And we have a strong reason to believe everybody will follow the guardrails, and that\nwill condition the behavior at the customer level, also over a period of time. So, I think that is what\nis going to take care of what you mentioned, that how would this discipline come in. This is how\nthe discipline will come. Given that the weighted average maturity at least for let's just Spandana\nin terms of the portfolio is only 8.6 months, if this origination is improved, at best two more\nquarters or three quarters you should be able to refine the entire book.\nShalabh Saxena: I would also want to add, Renish, before you go to your second question. For vintage customers\nthere is a practice to graduate them from a JLG customer to individual borrower and give a higher\nloan. We have stayed away from that path and we will continue to stay away from the path. The\nhope is that once there is some bit of discipline around, what we will see is, because ultimately the\nmoney lands into the family. So, once all of that is slightly pruned, we will see definitely some bit\nof an uptake in the repayment capability and capacity of the customer. Over to your next question.\nRenish: Sir second is again in terms of this stress, so if you can just highlight this stress in maybe last six\nmonths is coming from which state, district, etc. I mean, is there a real cash flow impact at the\nborrower level or is it just because of the pure overleveraging sort of which is leading to this stress?\nShalabh Saxena: No, this I think I mentioned, Renish. Trend is linear to the AUM that is there across the vintages.\nSo, what happens is that we cannot say that last year had this any problem, or FY ‘22 sourcing had\na problem, so it is not that. If I look at my five yearsyears, and just to give you an illustration. If\nmy four-year vintage customer is about 10% of my AUM, the contribution of that 10% in the\nGNPA and the SMA buckets also is equal, it could be 9 or 11, thereabouts. So, if that is a cause of\noptimism, because what happens, which means that there are multiple factors at play. While it\ncould also be, and I must add, see we are not picture perfect, it could be our inability to kind of\nreach out to that customer at that point in time, which could have led to where we are. I am not\nshying away from that at all.\nSo, hence, we have gonegone back to just repeating the point. When you have adequate staffing,\nwhen you have a motivated branch team and if you reduce the workload on them, we will be able\nto address each of these customers. Until now, Renish, in microfinance you would not need to\ncustomize a solution in case of a disruption. However, in the current times there is a need, this\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nwhole one-size-fits-all does not work. So, hence we will need to customize all of these resolutions\nback until all of them are back into the JLG channel and center meeting channel.\nRenish : Maybe just the last question, is more on strategy side. I mean, so let's say after every crisis things\nsomewhat changes. So, let's say post demon industry move to cash less disbursement, clearly now\npeople are talking about let’s say paper less or maybe time driven underwriting. So, after this crisis,\ndo you see there will be a need for a separate collection mechanism for this product as well?\nShalabh Saxena: So, look, it is a fair question with very subjective answers. Different people will give different\nanswers. There are companies already which are following 1 to 30 which will be with the loan\nofficer, and then it moves to a different team. Certain companies follow, once the customer flows\ninto a GNPA you have a different team recovering because the customer, for all practical purposes,\nstops coming to the center meeting. So, essentially it's a door knock. Now, if you were to ask our\nCompany’s view, we would prefer the latter. This is a very closely integrated model where you\nlend and collect, the same person lends and collects, and there is a group which influences both.\nThe moment you try to fracture it or you try to dislocate that model, there are implications which\nwill have to be dealt with or which will have to be felt. We are not in this camp, but we do believe\nthat, in our case and I covered it in my opening remarks as well, once a customer flows into GNPA\nshe practically stops coming to the center meeting. That is when a different team follows, there's\na lot of value that it will generate. Till the time, and once again let me add, till the time this is\nregularized, once it is regularized then you can move back to the BAU which was everybody does\neverything. I mean, one person, the loan officer does everything. But at this point in time it is\nadvisable to just focus on the 90 plus with the different team.\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Abhijit Tibrewal with Motilal Oswal Financial\nServices Limited. Please go ahead.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: A couple of things I want to understand. One is, I mean, in your slides you have talked about\nimproving KYC. I feel this is one topic which has not been addressed adequately by the players in\nthe ecosystem. So, what I am trying to understand is, during lot of findings that you did, what did\nyou come across in terms of the fact that all the players lend on voter IDs. And to that extent, right,\nI mean, that problem that we have heard of our customers having multiple voter IDs and taking\nmultiple loans on these multiple voter IDs, I mean, is that a very big problem could be in the\nindustry or something which is trivial and doesn't warrant much attention?\nShalabh Saxena: So, such instances, do they contribute to 5% of the book? The answer is no. The question is that\nwould you want to experiment this and take that call when you already have a situation at hand, is\nthe question that is to be debated. At this point in time, and that is why when we stopped it, we did\nnotice some of what you have already said, Abhijit. So, there were two options, what is the option?\nThe first is, when you acquire a new customer who's new to Spandana, and specifically new-to-\ncredit, you have to do lot of diligence, you have to go home, visit home and so on and so.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nOperationally the process is about two or three days. So, rather than walk that path we said for\nnow we will stop and continue to focus on customers who have taken the loan from somewhere,\nwhich is not new to credit.\nHaving said which, there are instances that have been noticed to the likes of what you have just\nmentioned. There are also instances where you do not get a hit at a point in time and then get a hit\nthe second time around if you try after the next day. So, there are some tech issues as well that\nhave to be grappled with. So, while we are dealing with that, is there a problem, the problem\naccentuates in this kind of a disrupted scenario. So, the best that we thought of was to avoid that\npath, and hence focus on customers and for people who are not new to credit, as in they have a\ncredit history. We do checks internally to ensure all the instances that you just mentioned in terms\nof multiple IDs and all of that. So, we tried doing it, because ultimately it comes from one source\nand can be checked. All it requires you to do is to ensure that you do it some two to three times to\njust validate the point that you just made. So, you have to be cautious and in good times these\nthings really go unnoticed. In these times, it's always good that these things come up and you\nintegrate it into a process so that it stands by the test of time in the future.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: The other thing is, I mean, during your opening remarks you touched upon your expectations of\ncost to income ratio, AUM growth will be slightly higher versus where we ended in March. So, I\nmean, maybe I missed it, but did you also guide on credit costs?\nShalabh Saxena: No, so this is a fluid situation, Abhijit, and we are avoiding that guidance point. Because see, when\nQ1 happened, to be honest, I mean, at least we took some time to understand the scale. At this\npoint in time, we are avoiding any such guidance. We will wait until Q3 to end for us to stick our\nneck out and either way, about 75% we would have done from a tenure point of view where in a\nyear you would have done three out of four quarters. So, that is when we will be in a reasonable\nposition. Well, the situation is pretty dynamic, so we are avoiding walking that path at this point\nin time.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Just one last question or two questions, one is a clarification question. But the second one for you,\ndo not you think that MFI players now need to start lending to their customers / vintage customers\nin 2H? Otherwise with the tightness, which is there in working capital, I mean, even your good\ncustomers might start exhibiting delinquencies if you do not loosen your purse strings. I am talking\nabout industry and the sector as a whole.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, I agree. See, forget the industry and what you do to the industry, it is about if a customer has\nbeen paying you well over the past 12, 24 months, 36 months and has been with you for long, you\ndo not hold back, right? You have to suffice the demand otherwise you will end up aggravating\nthe situation. I think that's the point you are making. And hence, now that we have built up a\nframework to ensure that you take care of your arrear customers in terms of the resolution and\ngetting them back on track, it is important that we, I mean, at least we as a Company as in\nSpandana, we have started the process of trying to ensure that customers, we keep meeting the\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\ndemand of the customer who are desirous of a loan. Obviously, the checks will be slightly more\nstringent from what we would have otherwise done, but then so be it. If a customer has been\nprudent and has displayed good behavior over the past couple of years and more, I think we should\nbe giving. And I am sure everybody, see, everybody takes time including us to respond to a fast\nchanging environment. My belief is that now we are seized of the problem. Everybody understands\nthe nature of the problem and the way out. And one of the given is that you have to start and\nregularize and normalizing the disbursement part, provided you are convinced on the customer's\nability to pay in the future. Because you also do not want a situation where you lend and then the\ncustomer goes the other way. So, it's a balanced view that one has to take. And we do believe that\nthat is the way forward.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: And just one last question for Ashish sir. Sir, is there a different methodology using which we\ncalculate our NIMs? Now why I ask is, I mean, other peers when they report the results, I mean,\ndespite so much stress there is no change in the way they report their margins. A large part of the\nstress which is seen in their P&L is in their credit costs. For us, I mean, I see that that hit is there,\nboth on top line as well as the credit cost. So, I mean, how should we understand this?\nAshish Damani: So, there are two things which will impact the top line, and thus NIM. One is, any flows into the\nGNPA, we reverse the incomes. So, I mean, the interest that has been already accrued. So, that\nobviously impacts the top line. The second thing is, any transactions that we would have done on\nthe DA side, that will also have an impact on both the denominator as well as numerator, the\nincome will move to a different line item for the quarter to the extent of whatever time frame and\nwhatever the up-fronting that happens. All of that goes into a separate line item, doesn't form part\nof the NIM when we do the calculation. These are the two primary things which will keep\nimpacting the calculation, Abhijit.\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Ritika Dua with Bandhan. Please go ahead.\nRitika Dua: Sir, actually one first basic question. Whenever everybody is reporting say like Spandana plus one,\ntwo, three, or maybe say like one NBFC MFI plus one, two, three, how is this getting reported?\nAshish Damani: So, every time, let's say, when we do the credit bureau, now for example we have said we will not\nbe the fifth lender for the existing borrowers, or if we are going to originate a new customer then\nwe will not be the fourth lender. If there are already three lenders, then we will reject the loan.\nOtherwise, when we give the loan we will report that we have lent. This is how the reporting\nhappens, and it happens every week.\nRitika Dua: And sir here obviously, sorry again, but then just here again only the NBFC MFI are the four which\nyou are looking at, and also only the MFI loan that you are looking at?\nAshish Damani: No, all the microfinance loans we are looking at, including if the loan was given by a bank or\nSection 25 or through a BC or any of the participants who do microfinance loans, all are covered.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nRitika Dua: But if this person has taken or a lady or has taken maybe, I do not know if that will exactly respect,\nbut if her husband has taken maybe a two-wheeler loan or something, or maybe some gold loan\nthat the lady has taken, that is still out of the purview?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, so let me explain. Sequentially there is a FOIR which is calculated, so first of all, the\nhousehold income has to be less than Rs. 300,000 for it to qualify for a microfinance loan. Any\nhousehold with anan income of more than Rs. 3 lakhs obviously do not enter our system. That's\none number one. Point number two is, in the specific example that you gave, where the husband\nhas taken a -two-wheeler loan, there is a liability which he must be servicing. That liability gets\nincluded in the allowable liability. So, 50% is towards expenses and then the 50% is towards the\nallowable as far as the installment is concerned. So, when you calculate the eligibility of the\ncustomer, all of this is taken into account. That's how sequential you have to work at. And then\nobviously what is the customers’ installment depending on the loan she takes will decide how\nmuch she is eligible for. On the gold loan there is a criteria which has already been announced, I\nmean, you were just illustrating the gold loan hence I am kind of picking on it. Earlier there were\nsome different methods which were used, now it has been standardized into how you calculate the\nliability of a gold loan also. So, net-net, the borrowing at a family level also enters into the\ncalculation of FOIR to determine the eligibility of the customer.\nRitika Dua: And sir, obviously why I am trying to understand this is, linked to my second question I have. So,\nobviously, of the NBFC, MFIs who have reported so far, which have actually been very transparent\nin terms of them plus the other lender exposure, obviously, we do not know so much from the\nother players. So, they obviously are disclosing on an average 12% to 13% at least is four plus for\nsomebody, and if I go by the conservative way that you are going --\nModerator: We have lost the line. Next question comes from the line of Kaitav. Please go ahead.\nKaitav: Hi, Kaitav here, Sir, good evening. Not a very resounding quarter, of course. But sir, you\nmentioned some areas of green shoots, and if you can throw some light around whether it is\nstatewide or still it's pocket for you to not elucidate too much? As in, are certain states coming\nback or it's just pockets that are coming back?\nShalabh Saxena: No, there are patches. See, there's nothing called a state. I mean, unless if there is a calamity,\nwhichever regions it impacts is what it will be impacted. So, my specific comment was, patches in\nvarious states including the ones which are stressed. But the reason why I am kind of dithering in\nterms of getting into the details is it is still not a trend. So, we do not want to celebrate earlier than\nwhat we should. We will just wait for it to become a trend. And our belief is that we should start\nseeing some turnaround so as to ensure that by the end of this year we are well in track to sort of\nput 2024 or FY ‘25 behind us and move towards into FY ‘26 with the smile on our face.\nModerator: Sure. Our next question comes from the line of Ritika from Bandhan. Please go ahead.\nShalabh Saxena: We lost you somewhere, so if you can repeat that question.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nRitika Dua: Yes, sir. Sorry, thank you for allowing me again, Sir. I would just move from an industry\nstandpoint. Like I am saying, the NBFC MFIs have been at least transparent in terms of the\nnumbers we know, we do not know it for the other players. But if I go by the way you have been\nconservative and not lending to even going to the fourth lender also now, that number then from\nan industry standpoint maybe could be like 25% of the book for some of the large players,\nincluding maybe for yourself also. And then maybe there are some bitsbits of the customers who\nare already unique and where we would have already been giving loans out. So, that combined\nbecomes a very large pie wherein if we continue to lend more, that might maybe, rather there is a\nlarge pie which is we are not continuing to lend more, how would the industry growth maybe pan\nout maybe looking more into ‘26 and ‘27. I think ‘25 is something which we all maybe can\nunderstand. But how would the ’26-‘27 growth rate look like, if at all, because if we now again\nlook to lend to them, then we are back to the same situation.\nShalabh Saxena: So, Ritika, see this is the problem. In a buoyant market everything looks rosy, and when things go\ndown everything looks very grim. Life is in between, there's a grey and we have to thrive in the\ngrey. So, one of the things that you have said, there are two things. One of the biggest\nadvantagesadvantages that microfinance as the industry has is that this is the last mile delivery in\nmarkets where customers still do not have access to formal channelschannels of finance. The\nalternativealternative for this is only the money lender, there isn't anything in between, which\nobviously is not a choice. So, the prudence or the discipline around has to be at an\nenvironmentalenvironmental level, which includes the players, which includes us, let me add, and\nthe customers as well.\nThe situation that we are in obviously is a reminder to everybody and also the customer, we\nshouldn't leave out the customers in this whole scheme of things, where they will realize and I am\nsure they will, that a good credit score is important to maintain for you to get subsequent funding.\nAnd that's very critical. So, that should set in very fast because this is a working capital loan for a\nsegment which needs the capital to thrive and survive. So, I wouldn't really get into painting a\ndoomsday scenario for ‘26 and ‘27. It is just that something triggered, something happened which\nled to some bit of disruption in the discipline. And obviously, we have been making this point\naround that once you have a control overover the number of lenders, there will be some, the\nregularization will happen much faster.\nSo, the demand is still intact. The penetration of the addressable market is still at 40%, 45%. So,\nyou still have a headroom. And India is still a very large country. So, it is just that of 40,000 from\nfive lenders is not the most ideal. 40,000 from three would be great. And then if you see the\nindustry data also, in the past two years industry has added from a 5.8 crores to 8 crores, so the\nindustry has added about two 2.2 crores customers or 20 million customers in a space of 24 months.\nSo, you are reaching out to newer, fresher territories. All those things are there. So, and that's why\nin my comment also I made this point Ritika that structurally there isn't any, I mean, this is a\ntemporary disruption, this is a transitory phase.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nStructurally both the demand and the income level, see all this while we have been discussing the\nincome levels, even if you, I mean, we read this, if you see our deck and we have made this point.\nLook at the average borrower outstanding. If you go to our slide number three, if you see the\naverage borrowing at a customer level over the past two years has hardly gone up. I mean, 8%, we\nare not even getting inflation here, 8% growth on a point-to-point basis. So, annualized will be\nprobably three, four or whatever that number is. Likewise, the ticket size also has increased by\n21% over two years, so which is what about 9%, 10% annualized. All of this if you see, I do believe\nthat these are signs that things structurally are okay. And people who believe in joint liability, and\nwe are one, if you were to continue doing what is right and get to a stage where you do not increase\nthe tenure, we do not do a 36 and 48, stick to shorter tenures, stick to lower loans, turn the loans\naround fast, I think we should be fine. Yes, we have to suffer from collateral damage, but then we\nwill do everything to ensure that we also do some things which we should have done but did not\ndo. So, unfinished agenda plus wait for the industry to kind of get this thing right.\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Aviral Jain with SG. Please go ahead.\nAviral Jain: I have a couple of questions, one is on the collection efficiency. So, has that stabilized? Because\nQ2 has been much worse than Q1, even for your weekly branches, and that's the first time where\nyou would see some sort of stabilization while you have clearly said that you have not seen any\ntrend as such but. But any specifics around the collection efficiency at a gross or net level?\nAshish Damani: Hi, Aviral, this is Ashish. Absolutes are something that will not be able to disclose. But yes, like\nShalabh was explaining, trend wise it is similar, there has not been much improvement that we\nhave registered or seen, but we are very hopeful that by end of the financial year we will see all of\nthis going back to normalcy. The reason is, we have taken a lot of steps in terms of deploying\npeople, adding a monitoring line in the branches, and the guardrails have been implemented across\nthe industry kind of will condition the behavior from the customer side and things should start\nlooking better.\nAviral Jain: And as a consequence, given we have deployed additional resources both at the branch level and\nyou have more recovery team for 90 plus, would it be fair to, and this is not asking for guidance,\nbut you could still have more slippages from a 90 plus standpoint and also from a zero plus\nstandpoint going forward in the next this quarter, which is Q3 and Q4 as well. Would it be less\naccelerated, that's my question.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, Aviral, that would be getting into specifics. And to be very honest, if we had a line of sight,\nwe would have been very forthright. However, at this point in time, and if you see my commentary,\nwe are cautiously optimistic. But however, the optimism is not one quarter, two quarters. Even a\nfour quarter is good enough and we do believe that by the end of this year once we are out of this\nproblem, the stage where we are in, it is not a quarterly discussion, it is a two to four quarter\ndiscussion. And I think we should look at this business, even if you look at the two, ideally we\nshould be looking at least a two-year horizon. But even if for discussion sake if we were to say, to\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nthe specific point that you have asked, two to four quartersquarters if we were to discuss, we are\nreasonably optimistic that once we reach the end of this year I think we will be in a much better\nshape.\nSee, the reason why microfinance as an industry is said to be resilient is for exactly the various\npoints that I have been mentioning in the commentary and the answers that we have been giving\nand Ashish has been given. The alternate product for the customer aren’t too many, there the\ndemand is intact. The income levels haven't been impacted. There could be some indiscretion here\nand there at a customer level too, two quarters have already gone by where everybody is feeling\nthe pinch, which is both enterprises and the customers. I think it should turn around fast is our\nbelief. And back to your question, are we seeing trends here? The answer is no.\nAviral Jain: And sir finally, the question of, you mentioned that you expect to end up with an AUM which is\nhigher than what it was when you started the year with. So, the acceleration in AUM would come\nfrom where, newer customer recruitment? Because industry would have weeded out all the\nborrowers who could not repay, then a regularized credit cycle would start. Also, on the supply\nside I would believe that a lot of undercapitalized smaller NBFC, MFIs would be facing lot more\ntrouble because they won't have the resources even when the industry situation normalizes to be\neven able to give out the sort of, on an aggregate basis, the overall supply potential in the industry\nwould be reduced given lenders will have challenges raising resources.\nShalabh Saxena: So, the growth will come, at least for our Company, I will speak for Spandana. The growth will\ncome predominantly from the existing base that we have for all the reasons that I have been\nmentioning until now in this call. We believe that that's a safer bet, that's point number one. Point\nnumber two, Aviral, is that for the past two quarters, while the demand nothing has gone, nothing\nhas driven the demand downwards. However, the supply has been constrained for the reasons once\nagain that we have discussed in detail. So, there will be a pent-up demand which is there, which\nfor now instead of going out and acquiring a fresh set of customers we believe that this quarter at\nleast we will stick to focusing on our customers, because we ourselves have a lot of potential within\nwhich we would not have explored in the past two quarters that we have been dealing with this.\nSo, for quarter four, we will evaluate when we end the quarter three. Our belief on the fact that\nthis is a segment which predominantly is a good segment, something has happened in the last two\nquarters which we are reasonably sure that things will turn around. Plus, apart from this, Aviral,\nyou are aware we have opened a lot of new branches, the weekly model itself about 450 branches\nwere opened in the last one year. All of them will start delivering. The customers who we had\nacquired are now graduating for a second loan. So, demand from our side is, when I say our side\nmeans the customer side is not an issue. It is just that we wanted to cool this whole thing down\nwithin. Once we are out of this, we will start, and in fact we have already started pushing the pedal\non the disbursements.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nAviral Jain: And one last question is, what sort of recovery would you be able to see? Again, this could be\ndifficult to project from today, but given your long experience in the industry, both you and Ashish,\nyou have a certain stock of 90 plus and there is a big write-off also that was taken some Rs. 268\ncrores this quarter. So, could there be recoveries given you have also put in a recovery team which\nis 300 people and then adding 200 more?\nAshish Damani: Aviral, like you rightly said, it is difficult to project in the current environment. But if one has to\njust go by the previous experience, then it can be anywhere between 20% to 30% in terms of\nrecoveries, despite this thing. Since this is not necessarily all of the hard bucket, it just flown into\nthe GNPA, there will be customers who might have had temporary challenges, there will be\ncustomers who might have gone into the stress bucket because of let's say our logistics issues\nwhich kind of Shalabh was explaining earlier. So, there are various kinds of customers who have\nmoved into the GNPA bucket. And thus, there is anan opportunity to collect higher than what one\nwould have, in a normal course, collected from this bucket.\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Ashlesh Sanjay with Kotak Securities. Please go\nahead.\nAshlesh Sanjay: First question is, on the weekly model, if I go back one year ago you had roughly actually slightly\nmore than 20% branches in the weekly model. Do you see that at least in those branches the\nbehavior on collection is different?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So, if you see the slides, slide number 10, our weekly collection efficiencies of right hand\nbottom table, the gross collection efficiency is nearing 97% and the net is 94.2%. It is in line with,\nwhile these branches are still in the same pockets or markets where a monthly branch is having\nslightly more stress, but clearly weekly branches are behaving well, better than the non-weekly\nbranches. So, this goes back to the point that we had made two years back that weekly branch is\nthe way to go. Things did not work out for us. We started with a good intent which was the project\nParivartan. Things didn't work out, but then at an appropriate time our fundamental belief is that a\nweekly is the way to go for the institution.\nAshlesh Sanjay: And secondly, if I look at the data which you have shared on slide number six, roughly 5% of the\nborrowers, when you disburse a loan to them, had five lenders associated with those borrowers.\nAnd given that average disbursement ticket size at the industry level is roughly Rs. 48,000 for a\nloan, what kind of gives us the comfort when we disburse being the fifth lender at that point in\ntime, even for the 5% set of borrowers?\nShalabh Saxena: Ashlesh, what happens is not every customer would have peaked off at the peak, when the lending\nis done. People would be at various stages of their run downs of the specific loans. This is at a\nlender. So, I could have five loans from five different lenders, one with an outstanding Rs. 5,000,\nRs. 10,000, Rs. 15,000, etc. Ultimately, all of this converges into the FOIR which is calculated for\nthe customer, and she would have been eligible at that point in time. That is why we walked that\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\npath. But nevertheless, we are wise now and which goes back to, and I am sure you would be\nlistening to the call that we have been on, and we have been highlighting this point that forget the\ntotal outstanding at a customer level, but there is a very clear correlation of the number of lenders\nto the behavior or the portfolio quality. That is irrespective of the indebtedness level.\nSo, intuitively, yes, more number of lenders means a higher dollar value of borrowing. But even\nif I keep that aside, that might not be, because when we further splice the slice, in same table that\nyou are referring to on the left-hand bottom table, you still have, in spite of the four vendors you\nhave few of them at under Rs. 50,000. This is a factor of what stage their loan run down is. So,\nthat is why we walked that path. But anyway, we are wiser now and I have been laboring this point\nthat we will consciously stay away from, this will be one of the criterias of deciding the loan,\nwhich is more number of lenders will probably shy away.\nAshlesh Sanjay: And just a couple of data keeping questions. Can you share the SMA 0 book and give the\nproportion of AUM which is sitting with borrowers having for more than four lenders?\nShalabh Saxena: Ashlesh, what was your first part of the question, we missed it?\nAshlesh Sanjay: SMA 0 book, that is one. And the proportion of AUM which is with borrowers having more than\nfour lenders, assuming that 13.8 is on proportion of borrowers.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So, if you can get in touch with us.\nAshish Damani: Yes. Hi, Ashlesh. Ashish this side. We will share the data with you. It is not handy right now, but\nwe will get back to you with that corresponding number on our 13.8.\nAshlesh Sanjay: So, this 13.8 is on is on number of borrowers, right?\nAshish Damani: Yes, that's right.\nModerator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, we have reached the end of question-\nand-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference over to the management for closing\ncomments.\nShalabh Saxena: So, thank you for all of you who are on the call. Clearly it was a tough quarter. All of the industry\nas well as us have our own set of challenges. The clear learnings as far as the enterprise is\nconcerned, and we are doing our best to ensure that all the learnings are translated into action, be\nit execution, be it the credit policy, be it the model that you are following and so on. So, we will\ncontinue to walk this path. As already highlighted to you, we anticipate things to regularize by end\nof this year. Until then, our job is very clearly to lend right and to collect right. So, this is what we\nwill keep doing. Thank you very much for all the support and best of luck and goodbye.\nModerator: Thank you. On behalf of Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited, that concludes this conference.\nThank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.\n",

            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nModerator: Ladies and gentlemen, good day, and welcome to Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited Q2 FY\n‘25 Earnings Conference Call.\nThis conference call may contain forward-looking statements about the Company, which are based\non the beliefs, opinions and expectations of the Company as on date of this call. These statements\nare not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to\npredict.\nAs a reminder, all participants’ lines should be in listen-only mode. And there will be an\nopportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need assistance\nduring the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing “*”, then “0” on your touch tone\nphone. Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI now hand the conference over to Mr. Shalabh Saxena – MD and CEO, Spandana Sphoorty\nFinancial Limited. Thank you and over to you, Mr. Saxena.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you very much. Good evening to all of you. Thank you for your interest in our Company\nand for taking time out to join us on this call. Most of you would have gone through our Results\nthat have been uploaded on the Stock Exchanges a couple of hours ago. While the Results are\ndefinitely underwhelming, please allow me to give you a context for these results.\nSo, let me begin with giving you some landscape on the industry, and then we will go into the\nspecifics of the Company.\nOver the past couple of years there have been subtle shifts that have happened in the sector. I will\ntake you through the happenings. Before that, as you are already aware, microfinance and the JLG\nmodel areare the mainstay of our business. Q1 was the first quarter where we saw signs of\nweakness in the environment when the sector was impacted due to the long-drawn elections,\nintense heat waves and the high attrition in a few states. This is what we had covered in our last\ncall when we met up with all of you.\nThe dilution of the JLG model, and when I say dilution, it is obviously not uniform but there has\nbeen a dilution post-COVID. That is taking time to turn around. This has impacted our center\nmeetings, the discipline around the center meetings, and a key indicator of a customer engagement\nbeing center attendance. That is still at 55% odd levels, so 55% to 60%, certain pockets are slightly\nhigher. I am just averaging it out at national level.\nAnother point is that the field attrition level, and this we covered in detail the last time around. The\nfield staff attrition level has been high over the past few quarters. Our understanding, and basis the\ndeep engagement that we have done over the past quarter, quarter and a half with our field staff,\nwhich is both the branch and the supervisory level, there are various reasons, and we will cover it\nin this opening remarks as well as in the subsequent questions, if people would have. There are\nvarious people who react to the various challenges that are there in the market or that exist in the\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nmarket. Our understanding from what we gathered was that most of them prefer to go out of the\nindustry. There isn't a significant percentage which is moving into the industry, so that is what I\nwould want to bring out.\nAnother point is, borrowers with established track record, they graduate or they are graduating to\nnon-MFI loans. While there's nothing wrong in it, it is just that in times like these it puts some bit\nof pressure on the finances of the family, and hence the repayment capability.\nThe last point on this landscape that I would want to highlight is borrower indebtedness, and we\nhave covered this in detail. So, borrower indebtedness is one of the challenges impacting the\nindustry. If we look at the borrower’sborrower’s indebtedness or over leveraging, I am just\nreferring to Slide 6 of the investor presentation. While when we gave the loan we had a particular\nposition, the position over the last two years as per the latest data available has seen a significant\nshift downwards from Spandana and Spandana plus one. The percentage of portfolio has moved\nand shifted downwards, and the numbers are given there.\nWhile you have been listening to us over the past many quarters, we have been maintaining a ticket\nsize of not more than 80,000, irrespective of the vintage, that's the max ticket size that we offer.\nThe tenure of the loans is 24 months, we introduced the 12 and 18. And we obviously keep a close\ntrack of the indebtedness at the customer level. So, the average indebtedness of a borrower with\nSpandana, while it has declined by 13%, however, we operate in an environment and hence we\nhave been impacted there. The details are there in the slides.\nSo, this is the background of the industry and the impact on us. Obviously, we are doing our best\nand the various initiatives that we have taken to ensure that we arrest the situation and we try to\nturn this around. The environment will have to play its part, but we are doing the best that we can\nas a team to ensure that we manage the two, three-clear vectors which are there which is; how you\nlend, how you collect; and most importantly, take care of your people.\nMore recently, the disruption was caused over the past few months in a few geographies due to the\nclimatic factors like heavy rainfall and floods during the 2nd Quarter. The sector has been\nexperiencing influence in the form of localized movements also, which has further compounded\nthe problems. As I mentioned, Spandana has not been immune to any of these challenges.\nDue to attrition over the past few quarters the share of loan officers, and we have highlighted this\nin the presentation as well. The share of loan officers in less than one year tenure at Spandana was\n67%, this has to be looked at in context because we have opened new branches, because our\nbranches which are big, we split those branches as well. So, that tenure has to be looked at in\ncontext. The 67% comparatively used to be about 50% - 51%, just about three, four quarters back.\nSo, there's a bit of a rawness in the team given the fact that we have had the various challenges\nthat I elucidated too.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nOn the branch On the branch manager’smanager’s side, and in the last earnings call we had detailed\nto you. We had taken many steps to ensure that the branch manager attrition is curtailed, which I\nthink we have been reasonably successful. There are regrettable resignations and there are non-\nregrettable resignations. So, of the regrettable ones, we had taken an organization wide initiative\nabout a couple of months back to ensure that we reach out to them. And we have been reasonably\nsuccessful. We were able to retain about 78% of the people who we wanted to retain. So, I think,\nas a headline if I were to say, the branch manager reasonably protected, and we will have to keep\nup and keep monitoring this important vector for the next few quarters.\nThe supervisory layer above the branch manager, we had some challenges, but that was not really\nto the extent where we would be worried, and we have kind of taken care of them as well. This\nquarter and the next quarter areare all about the loan officer and how do we engage with them to\nensure that we have reduced the attrition at the loan officer level.\nHaving considered the external and internal challenges, we had already announced a few measures\nduring our last earnings call. The teams are working hard to normalize the operations. However,\nas a measure of abundant caution, the following additional steps were taken during the 2nd Quarter:\n1. I covered this, prioritizing people – We introduced a few cultural changes in the way\nbusiness is conducted at Spandana, including focus on softer aspects like reward and\nrecognition, team building, increasing employee connect through multiple channels of\ncommunication and meetings, compulsory system shut down hours, leave policy, etc.\nAll of these policies and initiatives were looked at and we have had already implemented\nthem.\n2. Conservative lending approach – As announced earlier, Spandana had paused on-\nboarding new-to-credit borrowers. You would have read the guardrails and the way the\nindustry has kind of joined together to ensure that we bring discipline. As a matter of\nabundant caution, we have announced internally that the organization will not be the\nfourth lender to new-to-Spandana borrowers.borrowers. So, any borrower which is new-\nto-Spandana, we will be the third lender, although the guardrail allows fourth, but to\nbegin with, we are saying that we will be the third lender. So, this is slightly more\nconservative than the guardrails, and we will see as it goes. As things improve and we\nmight change, but at this point in time this is one of the initiatives that we have\nundertaken.\n3. Controls – Strengthening controls is something that we have been working on and\nmicrofinance is all about how well you put a policy in place and how well you monitor.\nSo, on the control side, optimized supervisory span of control and monitoring, further\nstrengthening of KYC checks, additional controls have been put in place to check frauds\netc.\n4. Collection focus – we have classified branches into three sets of branches, growth\nbranches, stable branches and focus, based on parameters like collection efficiency,\nportfolio quality, etc. Based onBased on this qualification we stopped new member\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nacquisition in about 46% of the branches, which are essentially the focus branches.\nSimilarly, we have put restrictions in place to stop adding new centers in 15% of stable\nbranches. So, while customer acquisition is on in these branches, but however new\ncenters we have just put a restriction to that. These restrictions, we believe, will help the\nfield team of these branches to focus solely on ensuring timely collection of dues and\nmeeting the customers’ disbursement requirements as and when they might need.\n5. As announced in the last earnings call, Spandana has created a separate quality assurance\nlayer at branches which will focus on process adherence, quality, customer service, etc.\nThis will help free up the branch manager's bandwidth, allowing him to focus on\nbusiness and control parameters.\n6. To ensure focus stays on collections, additional bench has been added across few\nbranches. AA dedicated collection team has been created, and borrower-to-loan officers\nspan in selectedselected branches has been reduced. This has led to an increase in OpEx\nto AUM for the quarter, as you would have seen. But then these are temporary pains for\na quicker than usual normalization. And we expect cost to income to be about 45% by\nend of the year.\nWe continue to believe that these challenges are transitory in nature and operations should\nnormalize by the end of the current financial year. We have not come across structural changes in\nrural demand or long-term dip in economic activity or macroeconomic outlook or income levels.\nSo, this is very critical. Next few quarters, as far as the Company is concerned, we will drive the\nrigor and discipline of how well and judiciously we lend, and how efficiently we collect. These\nare going to decide the coming quarters, and we as a team are geared up to kind of ensure that we\nrun this in a very well and efficient manner.\nNow, let me move to the regular Business Updates:\nOn the business drivers, owing to challenges alluded to earlier, Spandana was cautious in lending.\nOur disbursement for the quarter was Rs. 1,514 crores, a Y-o-Y decline of 40%. AUM at the end\nof Quarter 2 was Rs. 10,537 crores, registering a growth of 8% Y-o-Y. However, sequentially, the\nAUM declined by about 10%. Right now we are completely focused on ensuring that the stability\non the portfolio quality side comes up sooner than later. And hence, the slowing down of\ndisbursement is a part of the larger strategy that we have, wherein we give more time to the branch\nto reach out to the non-regular customers or the arrear customers. And we collect and get them\nback to a regular mode.\nThe day we are confident that this will happen, which we believe is not very far, the AUM will be\nstepped up. And by the end of the year, we should be slightly more than what we ended the last\nyear with, from AUM point of view. I thought I will just add this before I get into the next point.\nWith pause in the customer acquisition in large number of branches, our total customer acquisition\nfor the quarter was about 80,000 customers.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nIn every earnings call we give you details of our new, new lines of business which areare LAP and\nNano loans. Our LAP and Nano loans business under our subsidiary Criss Financials is growing\nsteadily. This we started about a year ago. We have now scaled the distribution to over 100\nbranches spread across six states, with AUM at the end of Quarter 2 at about Rs. 160 crores. The\nportfolio quality under both these products continues to be strong. We invested last year in setting\nup systems and processes and continue to believe in the strong market potential of these products.\nAt a Company level, we continue to maintain provisioning at 80% in the quarter because of the\nreasons that I alluded to. The quarter saw the GNPA increase to 4.86%. Likewise, our NNPA for\nthe quarter was 0.99%, up 46 bps over 0.53% reported at the end of June ‘24. On the liability and\nmarginal cost of borrowings, including the borrowing mix, during the quarter we borrowed Rs.\n1,584 crores. The reduction in borrowing was due to the cautious disbursement approach that we\nhad adopted as an organization. Our marginal cost of borrowing for the quarter was 11.4%, which\nwas 46 bps lower than Quarter 2 FY ’24 and 61 bps higher over quarter one of FY ‘25. Likewise,\non the borrowing mix, the bank contribution in the total borrowing has increased to 54% at the end\nof Quarter 2 FY ‘25.\nOn Quarter 2 Financial Year ‘25 Financial Performance:\nThe net interest income for the quarter increased 9% Y-o-Y to Rs. 341 crores, over Rs. 312 crores\nreported for Q2 of last year. Net interest income was down 20% over the last quarter. The PPOP\nfor the quarter was Rs. 228 crores, down 12% Y-o-Y, and 21% quarter-on-quarter. Yield on the\nportfolio was down by 202 bps to 22.4%. NIM for the quarter was 12.8%. NIMs declined as a\nresult of decline in yield and an an increase in cost of borrowing. Our efforts are constantly focused\non improving our cost of borrowing. However, the bigger opportunity lies in reversing the portfolio\nquality trend where we will get a lot of releases. For the profit after tax, higher provisioning at the\nend of the quarter has led to a decline in the PAT. And we have reported, as you would have seen,\na loss of Rs. 216 crores.\nWe continue to believe that these challenges are transitory and expect operations to normalize by\nthe end of the current financial year. The steps taken to course-correct will be monitored very\nclosely and all our actions will now be focused on improving the portfolio quality. We will\ncontinue to be prudent in our approach to lending, ensuring that our portfolio is well diversified,\nwhile staying conservative on ticket sizes and customer indebtedness. The entire management team\nof Spandana is thankful for the consistent feedback that we have been receiving from all of you.\nWe look forward to your continued support.\nWe can now open up for questions, operator.\nModerator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from\nthe line of Rajiv Mehta with YES Securities. Please go ahead.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nRajiv Mehta: Sir my question is on Stage-2, which has substantially increased. So, when I look at previous\nquarter, the kind of increase we saw in Stage-2 in Q1Q1, and then the flow which came in Q2Q2\nin Stage-3, it seems that the flow rates are significantly high. Almost everything is flowing from\nStage-2 to Stage-3, despite augmented collection effort. So, now that Stage-2 has further increased\nso substantially in Q2, would this assessment be correct that a significant part of it will flow in\nQ3?\nAshish Damani: Hi, Rajiv, this is Ashish this side. If we do simple math, maybe what you are saying adds up. But\nthe right way to look at it is, there has been almost 50% collections happening even in the Stage-\n2 buckets. Although the flows at the top areare what is contributing the flows going below, that\nneeds to stabilize and that's what we are working on.\nShalabh Saxena: Let me just add, Rajiv. The recruitment, we started additional manpower recruitment beginning of\nlast quarter, somewhere around July and August. So, the incremental benefits of all the people that\nwe have recruited and all the people who have been in the branches where we have taken, we will\nsee the incremental benefits only this quarter. That's number one. Number two is, even if, and I\nkind of mathematically obviously agree to you, but for the flows also which have happened,\nadditionally we have a recovery team now. We will not disturb the core of the model which is until\n90 the loan officer handles. Beyond 90, because we still feel we have analyzed Rajiv, the portfolio,\nthe customers who are kind of flowing, who have kind of crossed the buckets. There is no specific\ntrend of a particular quarter sourcing being bad or a particular year sourcing being bad. There is a\nvery clear linearity in the vintage and the contribution of the AUM and the subsequent percentage\nof SMA buckets, SMA customers in those buckets.\nSo, our belief is, for customers who have been with us for four years, five years, six years, it is\nprobably the current disruption in the environment that is leading them to not really honor their\npayments is our belief. So, our recovery team, which has now been set up, we already have some\n300-odd people, and in the next or rather this month and max by mid of next month, we will have\naround 500, 550 people who will approach these customers and we will start the recovery\ninitiatives. Because these customers from an intent point of view areare not an issue, they are all\nold customers with us. So, that should also incrementally play out to our benefit as we progress.\nRajiv Mehta: Got it. And just to understand that, the collection efficiency is now stabilizing or curtailing, if you\ncan get the collection efficiency of the zero DPD bucket and how it is moving between September\nand October, because I think Ashish did point out that the leakages or the slippages are coming\nfrom the top. So, if we want to understand that whether the slippageslippage at the top isis reducing\nnow incrementally, we need to know the zero DPD collection efficiency bucket. I mean, collection\nefficiency and how that is moving incrementally.\nShalabh Saxena: So, I will directionally answer that. October, obviously, will be difficult one to answer here. But\ndirectionally, is there a significant better movement? The answer is no, Rajiv. Are there green\nshoots in certain pockets? The answer is yes. Is there a clear correlation where you put people and\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nit is going to help you? The answer is again yes. And we are seeing some initial green shoots. But\nare the green shoots going to convert into a trend? It is too early for us to say. However, our\nunderstanding of the problem and the pockets that have been impacted and our various\nengagements over the past three months with the teams on the ground, I think we have a reasonable\nsense of the extent of the problem, and the next steps as far as the problems are concerned. That is\nwhy we have kind of recruited the people and put them in places where we have an issue.\nThe second additional point, Rajiv, also is the fact that there is, like it or not, because of the\nenvironmental challenges, most of the people have curtailed. Many companies, or rather\npractically every Company has curtailed their lending, and rightfully so. We are no different. So,\nthis has led to some bit of shortage in the circulation from a customer’scustomer’s working capital\npoint of view. So, we are dealing with all this. Our belief is that the customers’ intent is not a\nproblem, it is just some bit of working capital adjustment that needs to be done on her part. And\nmore engaged we are, the better the chance that we will be regularizing it soon.\nRajiv Mehta: And on this ESOP, I mean, what is the ESOP penetration within the Company? I mean, till what\nlevel have you distributed ESOPs and how many people would be covered, if you can give that\nsome color? And second is, you spoke about that you have been able to retain some of the outgoing\nBMs whom you wanted to retain, so how were they retained? I mean, were their bandwidth got\nreleased and which is why they stayed back, or some other initiatives were taken to retain them?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So, the good part, Rajiv, and it's a very good question because that's exactly our focus.\nBecause we believe that if you have happy people around, the rest is an outcome which can be\ntaken care of. For the specific point that you mentioned on the branch manager, because that is\nwhat we had identified the last time around because that was a problem that could be addressed\nbecause we have some 1,700 or 1,650-odd branch managers. We physically went out to them, the\ndifferent senior people went out to 36 locations and had a physical meeting with them. And that\nled to the turnaround where we were able to retain almost 78% of the branch manager who were\nserving notice. Now, did we offer them anything? The answer is no. Did we give them any other\nbenefit outside of that, that obviously is not correct also, because somebody resigns, you do not\nreally offer them anything which is monetary. All it required us was to have a good discussion and\nunderstanding of what were the issues that they were facing. And clearly there were issues and\nhence they were where they were. So, we were able to come back to them in terms of the action\nsteps, and we have some list of 10, 12 action steps which we had to take, which we have already\nimplemented at an organization level. So, that within a space of about 10 days, we had all of them\npull back their resignations.\nOnce we had our belief, and we continue to believe that if you take care of your branch manager,\nwhich we did the last time around, time our initiatives, now we have already started those\ninitiatives which is to connect at a LO (Loan Officer) level through the branch manager. So, ensure\nthat the branch manager and the supervisory level have their KRAs very well integrated to the\nlarger objective of the organization which is holding back the LOs. Once you hold them, because\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nany native knowledge which goes out of your Company, it takes about two, three months for a\nnew person to really come and then come up to speed. So, overall, I think we are very happy as a\nteam with the way we have kind of dealt with branch managers and above. As an organization\nreaching out to 36 locations across about almost about 2,500 people, which is branch managers\nand above, I think it it was a good step and a timely step which gave us results. I think another\nmonth, month and a half, I think we should be in a a decent position to at least come to a place\nwhere we, apart from the branch manager, we start seeing incremental results on the loan officer\nside as well.\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Shreepal Doshi with Enquirus. Please go ahead.\nShreepal Doshi: Sir my question was, I mean, while a few questions have been answered, but just a data keeping\nquestion. What is our Spandana plus four and unique-to- Spandana customer base?\nShalabh Saxena: You can see that on slide number six, Shreepal, there’s a table at the left hand top.\nShreepal Doshi: Okay, got it, I will go through that then. And, just another question was on this, the rise in PAR\nnumbers, right. So, is it fair to take it this way that the MFIN guardrails have led to an accelerated\nrecognition of stress or the movement of the Stage-1 to Stage-2 and then so forth has been pretty\nsharp?\nShalabh Saxena: So, Shreepal, here is my view. Any step which is taken which is good for the industry, should be\nwelcomed. And I think we have. And I do not know if you picked it up in my commentary, we\nhave said that new-to- Spandana, we are going a step ahead. We will not be the fourth lender, so\neffectively we are stopping at three. So, even if the medicine is bitter we will have to swallow it,\nbut the end result has to be that all of us get well, as an industry. So, that's where I am not looking\nat it one quarter or two months or one month, I am looking to the four quarters, eight quarters. I\nthink it's a step in the right direction. And I think that everybody is going to benefit out of this.\nShreepal Doshi: And then just last question, I think it is part of your commentary as well. You highlighted that\nmuch of the stress will get absorbed or say taken care of during this year itself. So, you think that\nwill be a function of collections improving from say December end and all over? So, otherwise,\ndo you think there will be spill over in the next year as well?\nShalabh Saxena: So, we still have about five months to go before the end of the year. As I mentioned, I think I gave\na lengthy commentary to Rajiv in the previous question. We are seeing some movement in the\nmarket, but it is still not a trend, hence I am hesitating to say anything in terms of, this is going to\nturn around by December or January. However, the last two quarters are the quarters which are\ngood for the industry, number one. Number two, we believe that with all the other initiatives that\nwe have taken, the initiative which the SRO has taken, I think, will ultimately lead to a situation\nwhere I think the environment operates for the right lending more than anything else. So, that's the\nbelief. I mean, it took three months for the position that we are in, we are still giving five months\nfor this to improve. So, I think we are already two quarters down this year where we dealt with\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nthis problem. So, my belief is that attrition stabilizing, environment stabilizing, lending slightly\ncurtailed, customer discipline back, I think we should by end of the year be able to come out of\nthis.\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Renish with ICICI. Please go ahead.\nRenish: Sir, three questions, so we will go one by one. So, sir, if you look at the slide, it is very much\nvisible that we have been prudent lender reflecting four plus lender share at the time of\ndisbursement at around 5%. But eventually it increases to 13%, clearly players are just lending\nwithout proper assessment, maybe leading to leverage. And despite being the conservative lender,\nwe have to pay a price for over leveraging done by others. So, how do you think this can be taken\ncare of going ahead? I mean, do you foresee SRO, regulator or anyone sort of talking about it and\nmaybe they are maybe in discussion stage, whatever, but any insights on this will be very helpful\nsir.\nShalabh Saxena: So, Renish, I partly answered so I will start and then Ashish will add. I completely agree with what\nyou said. With customers who are with us already, we have limited options but to go and keep\npursuing. Somewhere in the commentary I did mention that, for all the customer acquisition that\nwe are going to start doing now, if there is a borrower who is new to Spandana, we will not be the\nfourth, even though the guardrails allow you to be the fourth, we will be only the third. If we are\nthe fourth, then we will regretfully not do the case. So, that is one of the initiatives that we have\ntaken, because, Renish, we have kind of analyzed various data points all these months that we have\nbeen doing. While there could be patchy trends on various theories that you and I would have, but\none of the trends which is unmistakable is the correlation of lenders and the collection\nefficiency/GNPA. The more the number of lenders, clearly there is a higher pool of arrear\ncustomers corresponding to the AUM that you would have. I will give you a data point and Ashish\njust add to this. And five and greater than five lenders areare about 12% in our AUM, 12% - 12.5%\nin our AUM. And these set of customers’ contribution to the arrear bucket, which includes the\nGNPA is about 21%.\nRenish : Including the DPD?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, I took everything into this, arrears as well as GNPA. See, we are discussing quality, portfolio\nquality, be it a flow in GNPA as well. So, this is the point I am just trying to validate the point that\nI made, that the more number of lenders, there's a clear trend that it kind of stresses out the\ncustomer. Because more number of lenders you have to attend as many center meetings and so on\nand so forth. This is also one of the reasons why the center meeting attendance could be low,\nbecause four or five companies and weekly and combination of fortnightly and monthly, I mean,\nit's a bit of a stretch for the customer. So, that's the reason why to answer your question, we have\nkind of made it a policy until things resume back to normalcy.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nWe will continue to not offer new-to-credit customers a loan because I had covered this in detail\nlast time around because there's too much of operational time which goes and there are other things\nas well which influence this, that's number one. Number two is on this four and more than four. If\nit is an existing customer of Spandana, then obviously she has to be regular, and then we will see\nif she applies for another loan we will evaluate. But if it is a new-to- Spandana customer, then we\nare stopping one short of what is agreed upon by everybody, which is we will not be the fourth\nlender, we will stop at three.\nAshish Damani: The hygiene will get built overtime, Renish, because the SRO's have already come out with this\nguardrail. And we have a strong reason to believe everybody will follow the guardrails, and that\nwill condition the behavior at the customer level, also over a period of time. So, I think that is what\nis going to take care of what you mentioned, that how would this discipline come in. This is how\nthe discipline will come. Given that the weighted average maturity at least for let's just Spandana\nin terms of the portfolio is only 8.6 months, if this origination is improved, at best two more\nquarters or three quarters you should be able to refine the entire book.\nShalabh Saxena: I would also want to add, Renish, before you go to your second question. For vintage customers\nthere is a practice to graduate them from a JLG customer to individual borrower and give a higher\nloan. We have stayed away from that path and we will continue to stay away from the path. The\nhope is that once there is some bit of discipline around, what we will see is, because ultimately the\nmoney lands into the family. So, once all of that is slightly pruned, we will see definitely some bit\nof an uptake in the repayment capability and capacity of the customer. Over to your next question.\nRenish: Sir second is again in terms of this stress, so if you can just highlight this stress in maybe last six\nmonths is coming from which state, district, etc. I mean, is there a real cash flow impact at the\nborrower level or is it just because of the pure overleveraging sort of which is leading to this stress?\nShalabh Saxena: No, this I think I mentioned, Renish. Trend is linear to the AUM that is there across the vintages.\nSo, what happens is that we cannot say that last year had this any problem, or FY ‘22 sourcing had\na problem, so it is not that. If I look at my five yearsyears, and just to give you an illustration. If\nmy four-year vintage customer is about 10% of my AUM, the contribution of that 10% in the\nGNPA and the SMA buckets also is equal, it could be 9 or 11, thereabouts. So, if that is a cause of\noptimism, because what happens, which means that there are multiple factors at play. While it\ncould also be, and I must add, see we are not picture perfect, it could be our inability to kind of\nreach out to that customer at that point in time, which could have led to where we are. I am not\nshying away from that at all.\nSo, hence, we have gonegone back to just repeating the point. When you have adequate staffing,\nwhen you have a motivated branch team and if you reduce the workload on them, we will be able\nto address each of these customers. Until now, Renish, in microfinance you would not need to\ncustomize a solution in case of a disruption. However, in the current times there is a need, this\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nwhole one-size-fits-all does not work. So, hence we will need to customize all of these resolutions\nback until all of them are back into the JLG channel and center meeting channel.\nRenish : Maybe just the last question, is more on strategy side. I mean, so let's say after every crisis things\nsomewhat changes. So, let's say post demon industry move to cash less disbursement, clearly now\npeople are talking about let’s say paper less or maybe time driven underwriting. So, after this crisis,\ndo you see there will be a need for a separate collection mechanism for this product as well?\nShalabh Saxena: So, look, it is a fair question with very subjective answers. Different people will give different\nanswers. There are companies already which are following 1 to 30 which will be with the loan\nofficer, and then it moves to a different team. Certain companies follow, once the customer flows\ninto a GNPA you have a different team recovering because the customer, for all practical purposes,\nstops coming to the center meeting. So, essentially it's a door knock. Now, if you were to ask our\nCompany’s view, we would prefer the latter. This is a very closely integrated model where you\nlend and collect, the same person lends and collects, and there is a group which influences both.\nThe moment you try to fracture it or you try to dislocate that model, there are implications which\nwill have to be dealt with or which will have to be felt. We are not in this camp, but we do believe\nthat, in our case and I covered it in my opening remarks as well, once a customer flows into GNPA\nshe practically stops coming to the center meeting. That is when a different team follows, there's\na lot of value that it will generate. Till the time, and once again let me add, till the time this is\nregularized, once it is regularized then you can move back to the BAU which was everybody does\neverything. I mean, one person, the loan officer does everything. But at this point in time it is\nadvisable to just focus on the 90 plus with the different team.\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Abhijit Tibrewal with Motilal Oswal Financial\nServices Limited. Please go ahead.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: A couple of things I want to understand. One is, I mean, in your slides you have talked about\nimproving KYC. I feel this is one topic which has not been addressed adequately by the players in\nthe ecosystem. So, what I am trying to understand is, during lot of findings that you did, what did\nyou come across in terms of the fact that all the players lend on voter IDs. And to that extent, right,\nI mean, that problem that we have heard of our customers having multiple voter IDs and taking\nmultiple loans on these multiple voter IDs, I mean, is that a very big problem could be in the\nindustry or something which is trivial and doesn't warrant much attention?\nShalabh Saxena: So, such instances, do they contribute to 5% of the book? The answer is no. The question is that\nwould you want to experiment this and take that call when you already have a situation at hand, is\nthe question that is to be debated. At this point in time, and that is why when we stopped it, we did\nnotice some of what you have already said, Abhijit. So, there were two options, what is the option?\nThe first is, when you acquire a new customer who's new to Spandana, and specifically new-to-\ncredit, you have to do lot of diligence, you have to go home, visit home and so on and so.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nOperationally the process is about two or three days. So, rather than walk that path we said for\nnow we will stop and continue to focus on customers who have taken the loan from somewhere,\nwhich is not new to credit.\nHaving said which, there are instances that have been noticed to the likes of what you have just\nmentioned. There are also instances where you do not get a hit at a point in time and then get a hit\nthe second time around if you try after the next day. So, there are some tech issues as well that\nhave to be grappled with. So, while we are dealing with that, is there a problem, the problem\naccentuates in this kind of a disrupted scenario. So, the best that we thought of was to avoid that\npath, and hence focus on customers and for people who are not new to credit, as in they have a\ncredit history. We do checks internally to ensure all the instances that you just mentioned in terms\nof multiple IDs and all of that. So, we tried doing it, because ultimately it comes from one source\nand can be checked. All it requires you to do is to ensure that you do it some two to three times to\njust validate the point that you just made. So, you have to be cautious and in good times these\nthings really go unnoticed. In these times, it's always good that these things come up and you\nintegrate it into a process so that it stands by the test of time in the future.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: The other thing is, I mean, during your opening remarks you touched upon your expectations of\ncost to income ratio, AUM growth will be slightly higher versus where we ended in March. So, I\nmean, maybe I missed it, but did you also guide on credit costs?\nShalabh Saxena: No, so this is a fluid situation, Abhijit, and we are avoiding that guidance point. Because see, when\nQ1 happened, to be honest, I mean, at least we took some time to understand the scale. At this\npoint in time, we are avoiding any such guidance. We will wait until Q3 to end for us to stick our\nneck out and either way, about 75% we would have done from a tenure point of view where in a\nyear you would have done three out of four quarters. So, that is when we will be in a reasonable\nposition. Well, the situation is pretty dynamic, so we are avoiding walking that path at this point\nin time.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Just one last question or two questions, one is a clarification question. But the second one for you,\ndo not you think that MFI players now need to start lending to their customers / vintage customers\nin 2H? Otherwise with the tightness, which is there in working capital, I mean, even your good\ncustomers might start exhibiting delinquencies if you do not loosen your purse strings. I am talking\nabout industry and the sector as a whole.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, I agree. See, forget the industry and what you do to the industry, it is about if a customer has\nbeen paying you well over the past 12, 24 months, 36 months and has been with you for long, you\ndo not hold back, right? You have to suffice the demand otherwise you will end up aggravating\nthe situation. I think that's the point you are making. And hence, now that we have built up a\nframework to ensure that you take care of your arrear customers in terms of the resolution and\ngetting them back on track, it is important that we, I mean, at least we as a Company as in\nSpandana, we have started the process of trying to ensure that customers, we keep meeting the\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\ndemand of the customer who are desirous of a loan. Obviously, the checks will be slightly more\nstringent from what we would have otherwise done, but then so be it. If a customer has been\nprudent and has displayed good behavior over the past couple of years and more, I think we should\nbe giving. And I am sure everybody, see, everybody takes time including us to respond to a fast\nchanging environment. My belief is that now we are seized of the problem. Everybody understands\nthe nature of the problem and the way out. And one of the given is that you have to start and\nregularize and normalizing the disbursement part, provided you are convinced on the customer's\nability to pay in the future. Because you also do not want a situation where you lend and then the\ncustomer goes the other way. So, it's a balanced view that one has to take. And we do believe that\nthat is the way forward.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: And just one last question for Ashish sir. Sir, is there a different methodology using which we\ncalculate our NIMs? Now why I ask is, I mean, other peers when they report the results, I mean,\ndespite so much stress there is no change in the way they report their margins. A large part of the\nstress which is seen in their P&L is in their credit costs. For us, I mean, I see that that hit is there,\nboth on top line as well as the credit cost. So, I mean, how should we understand this?\nAshish Damani: So, there are two things which will impact the top line, and thus NIM. One is, any flows into the\nGNPA, we reverse the incomes. So, I mean, the interest that has been already accrued. So, that\nobviously impacts the top line. The second thing is, any transactions that we would have done on\nthe DA side, that will also have an impact on both the denominator as well as numerator, the\nincome will move to a different line item for the quarter to the extent of whatever time frame and\nwhatever the up-fronting that happens. All of that goes into a separate line item, doesn't form part\nof the NIM when we do the calculation. These are the two primary things which will keep\nimpacting the calculation, Abhijit.\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Ritika Dua with Bandhan. Please go ahead.\nRitika Dua: Sir, actually one first basic question. Whenever everybody is reporting say like Spandana plus one,\ntwo, three, or maybe say like one NBFC MFI plus one, two, three, how is this getting reported?\nAshish Damani: So, every time, let's say, when we do the credit bureau, now for example we have said we will not\nbe the fifth lender for the existing borrowers, or if we are going to originate a new customer then\nwe will not be the fourth lender. If there are already three lenders, then we will reject the loan.\nOtherwise, when we give the loan we will report that we have lent. This is how the reporting\nhappens, and it happens every week.\nRitika Dua: And sir here obviously, sorry again, but then just here again only the NBFC MFI are the four which\nyou are looking at, and also only the MFI loan that you are looking at?\nAshish Damani: No, all the microfinance loans we are looking at, including if the loan was given by a bank or\nSection 25 or through a BC or any of the participants who do microfinance loans, all are covered.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nRitika Dua: But if this person has taken or a lady or has taken maybe, I do not know if that will exactly respect,\nbut if her husband has taken maybe a two-wheeler loan or something, or maybe some gold loan\nthat the lady has taken, that is still out of the purview?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, so let me explain. Sequentially there is a FOIR which is calculated, so first of all, the\nhousehold income has to be less than Rs. 300,000 for it to qualify for a microfinance loan. Any\nhousehold with anan income of more than Rs. 3 lakhs obviously do not enter our system. That's\none number one. Point number two is, in the specific example that you gave, where the husband\nhas taken a -two-wheeler loan, there is a liability which he must be servicing. That liability gets\nincluded in the allowable liability. So, 50% is towards expenses and then the 50% is towards the\nallowable as far as the installment is concerned. So, when you calculate the eligibility of the\ncustomer, all of this is taken into account. That's how sequential you have to work at. And then\nobviously what is the customers’ installment depending on the loan she takes will decide how\nmuch she is eligible for. On the gold loan there is a criteria which has already been announced, I\nmean, you were just illustrating the gold loan hence I am kind of picking on it. Earlier there were\nsome different methods which were used, now it has been standardized into how you calculate the\nliability of a gold loan also. So, net-net, the borrowing at a family level also enters into the\ncalculation of FOIR to determine the eligibility of the customer.\nRitika Dua: And sir, obviously why I am trying to understand this is, linked to my second question I have. So,\nobviously, of the NBFC, MFIs who have reported so far, which have actually been very transparent\nin terms of them plus the other lender exposure, obviously, we do not know so much from the\nother players. So, they obviously are disclosing on an average 12% to 13% at least is four plus for\nsomebody, and if I go by the conservative way that you are going --\nModerator: We have lost the line. Next question comes from the line of Kaitav. Please go ahead.\nKaitav: Hi, Kaitav here, Sir, good evening. Not a very resounding quarter, of course. But sir, you\nmentioned some areas of green shoots, and if you can throw some light around whether it is\nstatewide or still it's pocket for you to not elucidate too much? As in, are certain states coming\nback or it's just pockets that are coming back?\nShalabh Saxena: No, there are patches. See, there's nothing called a state. I mean, unless if there is a calamity,\nwhichever regions it impacts is what it will be impacted. So, my specific comment was, patches in\nvarious states including the ones which are stressed. But the reason why I am kind of dithering in\nterms of getting into the details is it is still not a trend. So, we do not want to celebrate earlier than\nwhat we should. We will just wait for it to become a trend. And our belief is that we should start\nseeing some turnaround so as to ensure that by the end of this year we are well in track to sort of\nput 2024 or FY ‘25 behind us and move towards into FY ‘26 with the smile on our face.\nModerator: Sure. Our next question comes from the line of Ritika from Bandhan. Please go ahead.\nShalabh Saxena: We lost you somewhere, so if you can repeat that question.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nRitika Dua: Yes, sir. Sorry, thank you for allowing me again, Sir. I would just move from an industry\nstandpoint. Like I am saying, the NBFC MFIs have been at least transparent in terms of the\nnumbers we know, we do not know it for the other players. But if I go by the way you have been\nconservative and not lending to even going to the fourth lender also now, that number then from\nan industry standpoint maybe could be like 25% of the book for some of the large players,\nincluding maybe for yourself also. And then maybe there are some bitsbits of the customers who\nare already unique and where we would have already been giving loans out. So, that combined\nbecomes a very large pie wherein if we continue to lend more, that might maybe, rather there is a\nlarge pie which is we are not continuing to lend more, how would the industry growth maybe pan\nout maybe looking more into ‘26 and ‘27. I think ‘25 is something which we all maybe can\nunderstand. But how would the ’26-‘27 growth rate look like, if at all, because if we now again\nlook to lend to them, then we are back to the same situation.\nShalabh Saxena: So, Ritika, see this is the problem. In a buoyant market everything looks rosy, and when things go\ndown everything looks very grim. Life is in between, there's a grey and we have to thrive in the\ngrey. So, one of the things that you have said, there are two things. One of the biggest\nadvantagesadvantages that microfinance as the industry has is that this is the last mile delivery in\nmarkets where customers still do not have access to formal channelschannels of finance. The\nalternativealternative for this is only the money lender, there isn't anything in between, which\nobviously is not a choice. So, the prudence or the discipline around has to be at an\nenvironmentalenvironmental level, which includes the players, which includes us, let me add, and\nthe customers as well.\nThe situation that we are in obviously is a reminder to everybody and also the customer, we\nshouldn't leave out the customers in this whole scheme of things, where they will realize and I am\nsure they will, that a good credit score is important to maintain for you to get subsequent funding.\nAnd that's very critical. So, that should set in very fast because this is a working capital loan for a\nsegment which needs the capital to thrive and survive. So, I wouldn't really get into painting a\ndoomsday scenario for ‘26 and ‘27. It is just that something triggered, something happened which\nled to some bit of disruption in the discipline. And obviously, we have been making this point\naround that once you have a control overover the number of lenders, there will be some, the\nregularization will happen much faster.\nSo, the demand is still intact. The penetration of the addressable market is still at 40%, 45%. So,\nyou still have a headroom. And India is still a very large country. So, it is just that of 40,000 from\nfive lenders is not the most ideal. 40,000 from three would be great. And then if you see the\nindustry data also, in the past two years industry has added from a 5.8 crores to 8 crores, so the\nindustry has added about two 2.2 crores customers or 20 million customers in a space of 24 months.\nSo, you are reaching out to newer, fresher territories. All those things are there. So, and that's why\nin my comment also I made this point Ritika that structurally there isn't any, I mean, this is a\ntemporary disruption, this is a transitory phase.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nStructurally both the demand and the income level, see all this while we have been discussing the\nincome levels, even if you, I mean, we read this, if you see our deck and we have made this point.\nLook at the average borrower outstanding. If you go to our slide number three, if you see the\naverage borrowing at a customer level over the past two years has hardly gone up. I mean, 8%, we\nare not even getting inflation here, 8% growth on a point-to-point basis. So, annualized will be\nprobably three, four or whatever that number is. Likewise, the ticket size also has increased by\n21% over two years, so which is what about 9%, 10% annualized. All of this if you see, I do believe\nthat these are signs that things structurally are okay. And people who believe in joint liability, and\nwe are one, if you were to continue doing what is right and get to a stage where you do not increase\nthe tenure, we do not do a 36 and 48, stick to shorter tenures, stick to lower loans, turn the loans\naround fast, I think we should be fine. Yes, we have to suffer from collateral damage, but then we\nwill do everything to ensure that we also do some things which we should have done but did not\ndo. So, unfinished agenda plus wait for the industry to kind of get this thing right.\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Aviral Jain with SG. Please go ahead.\nAviral Jain: I have a couple of questions, one is on the collection efficiency. So, has that stabilized? Because\nQ2 has been much worse than Q1, even for your weekly branches, and that's the first time where\nyou would see some sort of stabilization while you have clearly said that you have not seen any\ntrend as such but. But any specifics around the collection efficiency at a gross or net level?\nAshish Damani: Hi, Aviral, this is Ashish. Absolutes are something that will not be able to disclose. But yes, like\nShalabh was explaining, trend wise it is similar, there has not been much improvement that we\nhave registered or seen, but we are very hopeful that by end of the financial year we will see all of\nthis going back to normalcy. The reason is, we have taken a lot of steps in terms of deploying\npeople, adding a monitoring line in the branches, and the guardrails have been implemented across\nthe industry kind of will condition the behavior from the customer side and things should start\nlooking better.\nAviral Jain: And as a consequence, given we have deployed additional resources both at the branch level and\nyou have more recovery team for 90 plus, would it be fair to, and this is not asking for guidance,\nbut you could still have more slippages from a 90 plus standpoint and also from a zero plus\nstandpoint going forward in the next this quarter, which is Q3 and Q4 as well. Would it be less\naccelerated, that's my question.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, Aviral, that would be getting into specifics. And to be very honest, if we had a line of sight,\nwe would have been very forthright. However, at this point in time, and if you see my commentary,\nwe are cautiously optimistic. But however, the optimism is not one quarter, two quarters. Even a\nfour quarter is good enough and we do believe that by the end of this year once we are out of this\nproblem, the stage where we are in, it is not a quarterly discussion, it is a two to four quarter\ndiscussion. And I think we should look at this business, even if you look at the two, ideally we\nshould be looking at least a two-year horizon. But even if for discussion sake if we were to say, to\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nthe specific point that you have asked, two to four quartersquarters if we were to discuss, we are\nreasonably optimistic that once we reach the end of this year I think we will be in a much better\nshape.\nSee, the reason why microfinance as an industry is said to be resilient is for exactly the various\npoints that I have been mentioning in the commentary and the answers that we have been giving\nand Ashish has been given. The alternate product for the customer aren’t too many, there the\ndemand is intact. The income levels haven't been impacted. There could be some indiscretion here\nand there at a customer level too, two quarters have already gone by where everybody is feeling\nthe pinch, which is both enterprises and the customers. I think it should turn around fast is our\nbelief. And back to your question, are we seeing trends here? The answer is no.\nAviral Jain: And sir finally, the question of, you mentioned that you expect to end up with an AUM which is\nhigher than what it was when you started the year with. So, the acceleration in AUM would come\nfrom where, newer customer recruitment? Because industry would have weeded out all the\nborrowers who could not repay, then a regularized credit cycle would start. Also, on the supply\nside I would believe that a lot of undercapitalized smaller NBFC, MFIs would be facing lot more\ntrouble because they won't have the resources even when the industry situation normalizes to be\neven able to give out the sort of, on an aggregate basis, the overall supply potential in the industry\nwould be reduced given lenders will have challenges raising resources.\nShalabh Saxena: So, the growth will come, at least for our Company, I will speak for Spandana. The growth will\ncome predominantly from the existing base that we have for all the reasons that I have been\nmentioning until now in this call. We believe that that's a safer bet, that's point number one. Point\nnumber two, Aviral, is that for the past two quarters, while the demand nothing has gone, nothing\nhas driven the demand downwards. However, the supply has been constrained for the reasons once\nagain that we have discussed in detail. So, there will be a pent-up demand which is there, which\nfor now instead of going out and acquiring a fresh set of customers we believe that this quarter at\nleast we will stick to focusing on our customers, because we ourselves have a lot of potential within\nwhich we would not have explored in the past two quarters that we have been dealing with this.\nSo, for quarter four, we will evaluate when we end the quarter three. Our belief on the fact that\nthis is a segment which predominantly is a good segment, something has happened in the last two\nquarters which we are reasonably sure that things will turn around. Plus, apart from this, Aviral,\nyou are aware we have opened a lot of new branches, the weekly model itself about 450 branches\nwere opened in the last one year. All of them will start delivering. The customers who we had\nacquired are now graduating for a second loan. So, demand from our side is, when I say our side\nmeans the customer side is not an issue. It is just that we wanted to cool this whole thing down\nwithin. Once we are out of this, we will start, and in fact we have already started pushing the pedal\non the disbursements.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\nAviral Jain: And one last question is, what sort of recovery would you be able to see? Again, this could be\ndifficult to project from today, but given your long experience in the industry, both you and Ashish,\nyou have a certain stock of 90 plus and there is a big write-off also that was taken some Rs. 268\ncrores this quarter. So, could there be recoveries given you have also put in a recovery team which\nis 300 people and then adding 200 more?\nAshish Damani: Aviral, like you rightly said, it is difficult to project in the current environment. But if one has to\njust go by the previous experience, then it can be anywhere between 20% to 30% in terms of\nrecoveries, despite this thing. Since this is not necessarily all of the hard bucket, it just flown into\nthe GNPA, there will be customers who might have had temporary challenges, there will be\ncustomers who might have gone into the stress bucket because of let's say our logistics issues\nwhich kind of Shalabh was explaining earlier. So, there are various kinds of customers who have\nmoved into the GNPA bucket. And thus, there is anan opportunity to collect higher than what one\nwould have, in a normal course, collected from this bucket.\nModerator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Ashlesh Sanjay with Kotak Securities. Please go\nahead.\nAshlesh Sanjay: First question is, on the weekly model, if I go back one year ago you had roughly actually slightly\nmore than 20% branches in the weekly model. Do you see that at least in those branches the\nbehavior on collection is different?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So, if you see the slides, slide number 10, our weekly collection efficiencies of right hand\nbottom table, the gross collection efficiency is nearing 97% and the net is 94.2%. It is in line with,\nwhile these branches are still in the same pockets or markets where a monthly branch is having\nslightly more stress, but clearly weekly branches are behaving well, better than the non-weekly\nbranches. So, this goes back to the point that we had made two years back that weekly branch is\nthe way to go. Things did not work out for us. We started with a good intent which was the project\nParivartan. Things didn't work out, but then at an appropriate time our fundamental belief is that a\nweekly is the way to go for the institution.\nAshlesh Sanjay: And secondly, if I look at the data which you have shared on slide number six, roughly 5% of the\nborrowers, when you disburse a loan to them, had five lenders associated with those borrowers.\nAnd given that average disbursement ticket size at the industry level is roughly Rs. 48,000 for a\nloan, what kind of gives us the comfort when we disburse being the fifth lender at that point in\ntime, even for the 5% set of borrowers?\nShalabh Saxena: Ashlesh, what happens is not every customer would have peaked off at the peak, when the lending\nis done. People would be at various stages of their run downs of the specific loans. This is at a\nlender. So, I could have five loans from five different lenders, one with an outstanding Rs. 5,000,\nRs. 10,000, Rs. 15,000, etc. Ultimately, all of this converges into the FOIR which is calculated for\nthe customer, and she would have been eligible at that point in time. That is why we walked that\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 28, 2024\npath. But nevertheless, we are wise now and which goes back to, and I am sure you would be\nlistening to the call that we have been on, and we have been highlighting this point that forget the\ntotal outstanding at a customer level, but there is a very clear correlation of the number of lenders\nto the behavior or the portfolio quality. That is irrespective of the indebtedness level.\nSo, intuitively, yes, more number of lenders means a higher dollar value of borrowing. But even\nif I keep that aside, that might not be, because when we further splice the slice, in same table that\nyou are referring to on the left-hand bottom table, you still have, in spite of the four vendors you\nhave few of them at under Rs. 50,000. This is a factor of what stage their loan run down is. So,\nthat is why we walked that path. But anyway, we are wiser now and I have been laboring this point\nthat we will consciously stay away from, this will be one of the criterias of deciding the loan,\nwhich is more number of lenders will probably shy away.\nAshlesh Sanjay: And just a couple of data keeping questions. Can you share the SMA 0 book and give the\nproportion of AUM which is sitting with borrowers having for more than four lenders?\nShalabh Saxena: Ashlesh, what was your first part of the question, we missed it?\nAshlesh Sanjay: SMA 0 book, that is one. And the proportion of AUM which is with borrowers having more than\nfour lenders, assuming that 13.8 is on proportion of borrowers.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So, if you can get in touch with us.\nAshish Damani: Yes. Hi, Ashlesh. Ashish this side. We will share the data with you. It is not handy right now, but\nwe will get back to you with that corresponding number on our 13.8.\nAshlesh Sanjay: So, this 13.8 is on is on number of borrowers, right?\nAshish Damani: Yes, that's right.\nModerator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, we have reached the end of question-\nand-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference over to the management for closing\ncomments.\nShalabh Saxena: So, thank you for all of you who are on the call. Clearly it was a tough quarter. All of the industry\nas well as us have our own set of challenges. The clear learnings as far as the enterprise is\nconcerned, and we are doing our best to ensure that all the learnings are translated into action, be\nit execution, be it the credit policy, be it the model that you are following and so on. So, we will\ncontinue to walk this path. As already highlighted to you, we anticipate things to regularize by end\nof this year. Until then, our job is very clearly to lend right and to collect right. So, this is what we\nwill keep doing. Thank you very much for all the support and best of luck and goodbye.\nModerator: Thank you. On behalf of Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited, that concludes this conference.\nThank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.\n"

Thank you, and over to\nyou, sir.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you very much, Sagar. Good evening to all of you. Wishing all of you a very happy and\nprosperous New Year and a very happy in advance, the 76th Republic Day. The management\nteam at Spandana is thankful you for your interest in Spandana and for taking time out to join\nus on this call.\nMost of you would have gone through the quarter 3 results that have been uploaded on the stock\nexchanges a couple of hours ago. All of you are aware that since the beginning of the financial\nyear, the microfinance industry in India has been going through a slightly difficult operating\nenvironment, owing to a multitude of factors. However, before we dwell on those factors, let me\ntake a step back and give you a context of what was the strategy we at Spandana adopted and\nwhat were we trying to deliver through it. And then we'll come to the results. Way back in July\n2022, when we presented our Vision Document, we had identified a few key levers which we\nfelt were important for the company to grow sustainably. The first was geographic concentration.\nSpandana's portfolio was concentrated then in a few states, which was a key business risk.\nTo address this, Spandana expanded its presence in predominantly northern states like Bihar,\nUttar Pradesh and Rajasthan where we did not have a meaningful presence. As a consequence\nof this expansion, the share of top 4 states in our portfolio reduced from 57% then to about 50%\nby end of December '24.\nSo hence, we tried as per the articulated strategy, we tried reducing the concentration and\nspreading it across to the regions that we were not present, which was predominantly the\nNorthern region. Point number two, we are a firm believer that weekly is a better microfinance\nmodel giving the organization opportunity to engage few times in a year with the borrower. In\ntimes of stress, it is easier for the borrower to pay a smaller installment. All new microfinance\nbranches, hence, which we opened during the past 2 years have had a repayment schedule, which\nwas weekly.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nAnd by the end of December '24, these branches contributed about 14% to the AUM. And on a\nregular basis, about 20% to 25% on new disbursements. Parallelly, we also launched Project\nParivartan which was to move the existing borrowers who were in the monthly branches from\nmonthly repayment schedule to a weekly repayment schedule. However, we have identified and\nwe have been informing you that there were implementation difficulties on the field, which\nresulted in elevated flows from these branches.\nWe have paused Project Parivartan now, in fact, we did it a couple of quarters back. However,\nwe will pick this up in the next few quarters when the business stabilizes because we do believe\nthat weekly is the right model to go in the future. Point number three, muted ticket sizes, shorter\ntenures and customer acquisition-led growth have been the cornerstone of our growth strategy\nover the past 2 years.\nThe maximum ticket size that we offer is INR80,000 and the maximum tenure that we offer is\n24 months. We don't offer any loan beyond 24 months, and we do believe that in the\nmicrofinance environment, this is the right thing to do. While we added about 9 lakh new\ncustomers in FY '23 and about 14 lakh customers in FY '24, respectively, in the current financial\nyear, and we've kept you updated as well, we have slowed down our customer acquisition owing\nto the industry challenges and have added only about 3.3 lakh borrowers so far this year. This is\na part of design. This is a part of the articulated strategy that we have for this year, given the\nsituation that the industry is in and we are in. Now that brings me back to the challenges that the\nmicrofinance industry in India is going through in the current financial year.\nAs we had alluded to in our previous earnings call, there are a number of factors that are playing\nout simultaneously across the country. The first is branch staff level attrition across the industry.\nIt continues to remain elevated. Point number two, with easy availability of credit, many\ncustomers, many borrowers had availed loans from multiple institutions causing stress in their\nfinancial position. This has resulted in increased delinquencies across.\nPoint number three, post-COVID, there has been erosion of discipline amongst borrowers with\nfewer of them turning up for center meetings as compared to earlier. So there has been a drop in\nthe center meeting attendance over the past couple of years. Group cohesion has suffered as a\nconsequence resulting in individual door knock for collections, thus substantially increasing\ncollection pressure on the branch staff.\nPoint number 4 is the external influence, which is a mix of various localized as well as national\nlevel occurrences, which have happened over the past 3 quarters. This also includes the debt\nwaiver movements, and there are some local challenges in small pockets across states like\nKarnataka, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and few other states.\nIf you look at Slide 5 of the investor presentation, we have dissected the microfinance portfolio\ninto zones and clearly South India appears relatively better than North India. Most of our\nexpansion over the last 2 years was in North India, and this has added a dimension to our current\nperformance. Having said so, we do see green shoots emerging in December '24. We have a\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nslide on this in the investor presentation, but I'll kind of elaborate. Our current book, which is a\ncustomer who was standard or not in arrear, the net collection efficiency has shown a trend\nreversal in December.\nIn December, we saw 2.2% of flows from the X bucket, which is the current bucket into arrears,\nwhich has improved from 3.6% in November. So 3.6% flow has gone down to 2.2%. Any\nimprovement in current book indicates a smaller pool which flows into the subsequent buckets.\nAs this trend solidifies, we expect delinquencies and forward flows to reduce.\nAnd while we are already 22 days, today is the 23rd day of January, we continue to see the same\ntrend as we saw in December and probably slightly better in quite a few geographies. So if this\nsolidifies into a proper concrete trend, then I think we will be sure that the reversal has happened.\nPoint number two, efforts on the field to engage with branch staff has shown some improvement\nin attrition rate during the quarter.\nOur annualized LO and BM attrition was 60% and 30%, respectively. While I'm cognizant of\nthe fact that a 60% Loan Officer attrition is way beyond the expectation where in a normalized\nscenario, we were anywhere around 40% to 45%. However, we are taking steps to ensure that\nthe Loan Officer level attrition is curtailed. The Branch Manager attrition at 30% annualized is\nmore or less very near to the normal, which was about anywhere between 25% to 29%.\nAs we have highlighted in our previous calls, attrition leads to a disruption in the center meeting\nand borrower discipline because it's the Loan Officer and the old, seasoned Loan Officer who is\nable to drive all these initiatives and any new person taking this initiative, taking charge,\nobviously takes his or her own time to come up the curve. So that was the disruption that\nhappened.\nWe were impacted by this. However, things are improving now. This should hopefully have a\npositive impact in the coming quarters. Point number three, we've added a control layer in 75%\nof the branches and are seeing strong traction in branch process hygiene factors like center\nmeeting monitoring, customer engagement, following up for missed payments on due dates,\nchecking the CGT, GRT process, etcetera, are some of the many things that the control employee\nwhos stationed at the branches is supposed to be doing.\nWe've hired this layer for the last, and we've kept on increasing it for the last about 5 months, 6\nmonths, and we are seeing good results of it. We'll continue driving this and we will ensure that,\nsay, in the next 1 quarter, we will have all our branches manned by the branch quality manager.\nThe green shoots are encouraging, and we are doubling our efforts to strengthen business --\nstrengthen the business fundamentals, thus setting up the organization for future growth.\nAnother point which is very critical is the recovery from the delinquent pool. Recovery from\ndelinquent pool is one major focus area where we believe borrowers will repay as the stress\nabates and once the industry adopts the slightly tighter credit rules. On analysis of the delinquent\nportfolio, which is the GNPA pool and upwards, we have seen that a large portion of customers\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nare seasoned and vintage customers, who are probably not currently in a position to pay.\nHowever, their intent is okay.\nIt is an ability issue, it is a capability issue. We believe that a separate team engaging with them\nwould help us get the results on this pool. Hence, a dedicated recovery team of 600 has been\nfollowing up with the borrowers to recover dues. The team of 600 has just been beefed up and\nhas been increased. However, we are seeing an encouraging trend over the past 3 quarters with\nabout INR21 crores recovered in quarter 3 alone.\nThe trend has further continued in January, where the recovery so far has been equivalent to the\nfull month of December. So we are on track, and this is something that we will pursue for the\nnext minimum 4 quarters. We plan to take the count of dedicated recovery team to about 1,000\nby March '25.\nThe team is actively assisted by the various tele calling infrastructure who encourage borrowers\nto repay their dues and improve their credit record. While we had a team pursuing this portfolio\nuntil now, we are increasing the team size as we see more potential in the recoveries from this\npool in the coming quarters.\nAs the external situation improves, we want to be ready with enough capital to drive future\ngrowth. We have been maintaining about 17% of assets as cash and equivalents, which provides\nus with enough liquidity to meet all the organizational obligations. The capital position of the\ncompany is strong as is evident from the CRAR of 35.7%. The Board, taking in view the future\ngrowth has given an approval to raise up to INR750 crores of confidence capital. While we are\nin no immediate need of capital, however, considering the market conditions, the company will\nraise the said confidence capital at an appropriate time, and we will initiate the steps now.\nNow over to the results. The current trends, while they are encouraging and operations should\nnormalize, hopefully by end of quarter 2 of next year. Because we have not come across any\nstructural changes, either in the rural demand or long-term dip in the economic activity or the\nmacroeconomic outlook. Let me now move to regular business updates.\nBusiness drivers.\nDuring the quarter, the company adopted a cautious approach to lending. We followed a cautious\napproach because of the fluid situation in the market and hence had curtailed our disbursements\nconsiderably. Our disbursement for the quarter was INR1,443 crores, a Y-o-Y decline of 43%\nand a 5% quarter-on-quarter decline. AUM at the end of quarter 3 was INR8,936 crores\nregistering a decline of 14% Y-o-Y.\nThe AUM is an outcome of disbursements as all of us know, and we are confident that once the\ndust settles, we'll be back to driving growth. With the pause in customer acquisition in almost\nabout 800 branches and pausing onboarding new to credit borrowers, our total customer\nacquisition for the quarter was about 47,000 customers. The new business that we had launched,\nour LAP and Nano business, which we started a year ago under our subsidiary, Criss Financial\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nis growing steadily. During the last quarter, we crossed the 10,000 borrower milestone and an\nAUM of INR180 crores.\nThese products are offered in 6 states and across 105 branches. The portfolio quality under both\nthese products continues to be strong. We continue to believe in the strong market potential of\nthese products.\nNow we move to portfolio quality. We continue to maintain provisioning at 80%. We believe\nthis is among the highest in the industry. GNPA at the end of the quarter was 4.85%, an increase\nof 324 bps Y-o-Y.\nSequentially, the GNPA was flat. Likewise, our NNPA for the quarter was 0.98%, flat against\nSeptember of '24. On the liability and marginal cost of borrowing, including the borrowing mix.\nDuring the quarter, we borrowed INR872 crores. The borrowings were calibrated keeping in\nview disbursements and the organization's liquidity requirement. All of you are aware of the\nqualifying asset criteria that has to be maintained and hence, more prudence on the borrowing\nside.\nOur marginal cost of borrowing for the quarter was 12.2%, which was about 8 bps lower than\nthe previous year and about 41 bps higher than the previous quarter. Likewise, if I look at the\nborrowing mix, we now have a more healthy mix with banks contribution increasing to 55% at\nthe end of quarter 3.\nThe quarter 3 FY '25 financial performance. The net interest income for the quarter was INR265\ncrores over INR309 crores reported for quarter 3 of last year. NII was lower by 22% over the\nlast quarter. PPOP for the quarter was INR78 crores, which is down 67% Y-o-Y. The decline in\nPPOP was largely on account of shrinking loan book and increase in the opex because of the\nbench strength that we've created. Yield on the portfolio was down 291 bps Y-o-Y to 21.1%,\nyield declined by 128 bps over the previous quarter. And we'll cover in the various questions\nthat we get asked on the details of the yield. NIM for the quarter was 11.3%, down 195 bps Y-\no- Y. NIMs declined as a result of decline in yield and increase in the cost of borrowing. We are\nconsistently working towards improving our cost of borrowing. The company reported a net loss\nof INR440 crores for the quarter on account of higher provisions. We will once again, in the --\nduring the call, we'll break this INR440 crores to you so that you have a better sense of what\nwas the contribution into this INR440 crores.\nGiven the challenges, we'll continue to maintain a cautious stand until the green shoots solidify\ninto concrete trends. We are optimistic that the situation should normalize by end of quarter 1 or\nbeginning of quarter 2 of FY '26. We are maintaining an agile approach and are implementing\nsteps where necessary. We are also closely monitoring outcomes thereof. We continue to be\nprudent in our approach to lending, ensuring that our portfolio is well diversified, while staying\nconservative on ticket sizes and customer indebtedness.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nThe entire management team of Spandana is thankful for the consistent feedback that we have\nbeen receiving from all of you. This brings me to the end of my commentary. We look forward\nto your continued support, and we are ready for the questions.\nModerator: Thank you very much. Our first question comes from Mahrukh Adajania from Nuvama. Please\ngo ahead.\nMahrukh Adajania: So I just had a couple of questions that the new guardrails and one will be implemented in April\nas well. How will that put further pressure on asset quality in the first quarter? So you're talking\nabout things peaking out in the first quarter, right? Does that include the impact of any\nguardrails?\nOr how do we view it? That's my first question. And secondly, that growth will slow down. This\nwas a discussion at another call also. Growth will slow down post new guardrails. So what kind\nof AUM growth can we build for FY '26? I know longer term, it would pick up across the cycle.\nBut just for FY '26, because already, in the fourth quarter, we won't expect much growth. So on\nthe exit AUM, what is the kind of growth that we could build in? That's my next question.\nShalabh Saxena: So thanks, Mahrukh. Your first question was around guardrails. As we speak, we already, as an\nindustry, have implemented the guardrails one, which came into effect from July where there\nwere various criteria which were laid down on the guardrail one, of which the primary one was\nthe number of lenders, which was restricted to 4. So you can be the fourth, you cannot be the\nfifth.\nSo while, yes, in the short term, it does create an impact because if you go back to post-COVID\nfor the past 2 years, there have been instances where there were customers who were arrear and\ndelinquent with somebody else still getting loans with some companies where they either they\nhad a relationship or they didn't have. So that was the environment which the customers had\ngotten use to, which now obviously with the guardrail implementation and stricter enforcement\nof the -- what kind of customers you can acquire at -- from a delinquency or a DPD bucket level.\nI think it kind of in the long term helps restore some discipline across the industry, including the\ncustomers.\nSo it was a good thing to happen. And in spite of that, you are seeing that uptick, as I mentioned\nin December. And when I say uptick, it is across the industry. And I've spoken to a few people,\neverybody has experienced this trajectory going up. So yes, Mahrukh, and then in April, there's\na guardrail 2 coming where the number of lenders comes down from 4 to 3. Will it have an\nimpact?\nThe answer is, yes, in the short term, 110%. In the long term, however, you are back to bringing\ndiscipline to the customer. What it also does is that across 2 enterprises, if a customer is current\nwith somebody and and a delinquent or an arrear customer is somebody else, she will have to\nensure that her arrear account is clear for her to be eligible to borrow from any entity. There are\nrules in terms of the customer should not be more than 60 DPD if you have to give a loan,\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\netcetera. We've gone slightly ahead from -- instead of 60, we are saying we are getting it down\nto 30. And then I just answer this as to and I'll qualify why.\nWhat happens Mahrukh, is that in a situation as this, it is better to err on the side of caution\nrather than really kind of going overboard when it comes to deciding as to which customer to\nlend. And hence, to your second question on the growth and what will be the AUM. My guess\nis year '26 will be a mix of consolidation, discipline and growth. It will not just be a growth,\nnumber one.\nNumber two, because the first quarter, second quarter, there could be an impact. Either way,\nMahrukh, you are also aware. First quarter is typically a very mute quarter because companies\nlenders do get into the groove. There are -- the situation is such that the first quarter is never\nhigh on from the lender side as well. So it's a good time to kind of enforce this.\nAnd while we've kind of taken that extra step in terms of doing it now, but the industry, when it\nhappens in April, probably at best, well the customers will take about a quarter to kind of settle,\npost which then all customers will have to do is to be prudent and they'll have to balance their\nportfolio in terms of where to borrow and which loans to kind of conclude.\nSo yes, long answer to your question, but the answer is, we will as an industry, we will have to\nkind of take it as it is because this is a marathon. This is not a 100 meters or this is not a T20. So\nyes, it could impact 1 quarter even a 2 for that matter. But then long term, it's good. It'll build\nsustainability in the business, and it will help us. To your specific question in terms of what are\nwe targeting, I think we should -- I mean the year has still not ended. But I think a growth of\naround 15% is a good number to target from our year-end numbers. That's a good number.\nAnd then we'll see how the year progresses because when this year started, we did not know\nhow things were moving. We did not know what was coming. FY '26, obviously, we are better\nprepared. And it's always good to kind of be cautious. And if things improve quarter 3, quarter\n4, we will kind of relook at it. But at this point in time, I think a 15% exit number FY '26 of\nabout INR10,000 crores of AUM should be a good number to target.\nMahrukh Adajania: In the next quarter -- I mean, in the current quarter, the AUM will consolidate, right? Because\nthe focus is still on cleanup. Is that a fair view?\nShalabh Saxena: Your question is right. And the answer is, yes. The current focus of our company is to ensure we\nget the portfolio right. This year also has taught a lot of lessons to everybody, including us in\nterms of how much to grow, where to grow, which areas to target, which pockets to target. A\nbureau check at the time of loan is not the be all or end all, you have to keep track of the customer\nand so on and so forth. So lot of realignment will happen in terms of geographies. I mentioned\nin my commentary that South behaved slightly better than north. But does not mean it will\nbehave every time the same.\nSo you have to calibrate your strategies, basis – the customer experience and the customers\nrepayment behavior over these last 3 quarters. Once we have that, we will know exactly where\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nto grow. But as I say, the environment also has to kind of warm up to this whole new world. And\nI think I'm reasonably confident that 1 quarter or at best 2 quarters is good enough for things to\nstabilize and then we kind of move on.\nModerator: The next question comes from Shreepal Doshi from Equirus. Please go ahead.\nShreepal Doshi: My question was on the X bucket collection efficiency for states like Bihar, Karnataka and MP,\nwhich happens to be the key states for us. So if you can just highlight this kind of trend for these\nstates.\nShalabh Saxena: This is the X bucket collection efficiency, the 97.8%, that is in Slide 5 or 6. That's the one you're\ntalking about, right?\nShreepal Doshi: Yes, yes, that is for the whole company, right? I mean I'm talking about these three – four states.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, yes, yes. I got it. I got it. So Bihar is about 30, 35 bps lower. Karnataka this month, last\nmonth was okay, this month is experiencing a bit of -- and you would have read news about\nwhatever is happening. But that should settle because there is a lot of interventions. So that\nshould settle hopefully by end of this month. But Karnataka this month is clocking slightly about\n30, 40 bps lower than the number that you see. What were the other states, Bihar, Karnataka\nand...\nShreepal Doshi: MP and Maharashtra?\nShalabh Saxena: Maharashtra is okay, MP is okay. Yes, MP, Maharashtra are in -- I mean, give 5 or 10 bps here\nand there, they are almost clocking at the national average.\nShalabh Saxena: Bihar is trending a bit lower. That is very, very clear. The team says that this month, they catch\nup with the country. Currently, they are at a lower number. Karnataka last month was okay. This\nmonth is about 30, 40 bps lower. The other 2 states are just around the national average. Nothing\nof concern.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it. And sir, just one question was on this flow rates. So basically if you could highlight the\nPAR 0 number or PAR 1 to 30 DPD number for us for this quarter and for the last quarter\nbecause you highlighted 31 to 180 DPD, but if you could also give details about 1 to 30 DPDs\nnumber?\nShalabh Saxena: So, Shreepal, yes, Shreepal, the 1 to 30 number last quarter was about INR527 crores. This\nquarter, the closing number was about INR348 crores. So that number has been coming down.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it. That is helpful. Sir, second question was on this -- we've not been able to meet the RBI\nrequirement of 75% for microfinance loans. If you could just give some clarification on that\nparticular aspect?\nShalabh Saxena: Shreepal, the qualifying assets is a metric which needs to be met. I'm sure it's on the balance\nsheet level, you have to have 75% of your lending to be qualifying assets. Now in the current\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nsituation, we had deliberately slowed down the disbursements. That had an impact on the\nqualifying assets. Plus we have been holding cash on the balance sheet, which obviously then as\na percentage became higher than whatever the threshold could have been at the end of this thing.\nSo these metrics in the current situation, go for a toss for a little bit, and we are already working\nwith the regulator on the aspect.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it, sir. Got it. Sir, just one last question was on branch expansion side. So while we are going\nthrough turbulent times on maintaining our books, what is the reason or what is the thought\nprocess behind adding these branches even during this quarter? And I see that the branches that\nyou added, large number is in the -- based on monthly collection model?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Shreepal, we -- these branches that you're talking about are split branches. They are not\n-- I mean, while they are technically new branches, but when a portfolio grows beyond INR10\ncrores INR12 crores, that is beyond the threshold of our comfort because it becomes difficult to\nmanage. So all the new branches that we have opened this year, this entire year, not just this\nquarter, are all split branches. This year, by end of the year, I think we should have about 105 or\n106 new branches, but all of them will be split. They are not absolutely brand new. They come\nwith the portfolio already.\nModerator: The next question comes from Abhijit Tibrewal from Motilal Oswal.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: So my first question is given that there are green shoots now in December, and you said that\nthings are looking similar in January. Based on your conversations, do you think is there an\noutside chance that the implementation of the MFIN guardrail 2.0 can be permanently deferred?\nShalabh Saxena: No. So Abhijit, look, I can't speak for MFIN. We have given our position clearly. And there is\nno reason to not believe whatever deadline that MFIN has given. So it has been deferred from\nJanuary to April. As far as we are concerned, we've gone that extra mile. I think we've put it out\n-- put out a slide and we have a section in the slide where we say that we will restrict ourselves\nto 3 lenders.\nObviously, it's purely internal and voluntary because we do believe that it's important to take\nthese slightly more tighter norms. I know there will be an impact. There will be a higher\nrejection. But at this stage, I think we have to ward this time by being overcautious rather than\ngoing the other way. So as far as we are concerned, we are already in line.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. And then a related question on one of the slides, you've given out the lender overlap, the\nSpandana, Spandana plus 1, 2, 3, 4. So intuitively one would have thought that given that\nguardrails 1.0 had already been implemented, the customers with Spandana plus 4 or Spandana\ngreater than 4 could have come down. Is there a denominator effect that we are seeing that 13.8%\nin October has moved to 15.8%?\nAshish Damani: Yes, absolutely right, Abhijit. So there are 2 metrics which are pushing the number higher. One\nis the denominator because the customers who are paying off falling off from the numbers clearly\nimpacts this. The second is if you know our existing customers who are there at, let's say\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nSpandana plus 3 or whatever and have taken a loan. Then probably there is another reason why\nthe numbers will slip from the higher rows into the lower rows.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Sir, but now that as an industry, no one is giving loans to the customers who have four loans\nalready, right? Then how are some of these customers able to get a fresh loan?\nShalabh Saxena: No, no. What is the guardrail 1, you cannot be the fifth lender. You can be the fourth lender. The\nentire industry, still not every customer has already reached the brim. So there are customers at\nvarious stages. And they will progress towards whichever way.\nSo the loans are there. It is just that -- see it is a credit demand, high demand segment, where the\nday you want to switch on the loan tap, it will start coming. At this stage, obviously, in spite of\nthe eligibility of the customer, at least I speak for ourselves, we are being cautious. And likewise,\nthere are few more who are cautious.\nSo it is not about whether customers are able to take a loan or not. It is about how much is the\nwillingness of the lender in this situation to kind of go overboard on the lending side. So it's a\ntough one, Abhijit, but I guess this should be -- we have to wait it out for 1 quarter, 1.5 and then\nlet's see how things go.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. And just one last question for you. And Ashish, sir. Sir, I mean you said that by end of\n1Q or early 2Q things should normalize. Given that, I mean, we are seeing some green shoots in\nthe sector. Add to that the fact that maybe April onwards when MFIN guardrails 2.0 get\nimplemented. So next 6 months, how should the trend be is what I'm kind of trying to\nunderstand?\nHave you been able to get some handle on what could be the credit cost now over the next couple\nof quarters? And for you, Ashish, sir, I mean, while we've managed to keep our GNPA number\nat almost same levels as last quarter. Except GNPAs, have there been any other covenant\nbreaches that you have seen?\nAshish Damani: So I'll answer first. There have not been any other breaches that we have seen. It's all related to\nquarterly profitability that we had and the tangible net worth bit, which is obviously records,\neven the write-offs is taken into the consideration. So that is how those are the 2, but otherwise,\nnothing else.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: And Shalabh sir, my first question where I asked how the next 6 months are going to trend, given\nwhat we've seen in December and January? And if we are...\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Abhijit, I was just in the process of -- and after I finish your question, there was a\nquestion that Shreepal had asked, which I had kind of given an approximate answer. I have the\nanswer. So I'll give that answer after I'll finish your question. So the next 6 months, I'll just\nstretch it 2Q which is this quarter and the Q1, and I'll add the Q2 as well of next year.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nMy guess is that one should kind of just hold the fort on the ongoing -- the disbursements have\nto start. The disbursement story has to start, goes without saying because you have to meet the\ncustomer demand, but you have to do cherry picking as far as your customers are concerned.\nThat's number one. Number two is, the portfolio quality and driving the discipline.\nThis is, in fact, should have been number one, which is driving the center meeting discipline in\nthe JLG model that most of the industry follows. It is extremely critical that this door knock\nmodel, which is the customers being difficult in terms of attending the center meetings has to be\nkind of curtailed and we have to ensure that the customer comes and turns up at the center\nmeeting because door knock is a very inefficient way of operating this model. And frankly, for\nthe number of customers that all of us deal with, we are at about some almost 3 million\ncustomers. Even a 10% is a good, good number, which is very difficult to manage. So not a\nviable model from an employee stress perspective and even operational efficiency. So because\nright now, while we are preparing our powder for the next 2 quarters on the growth side.\nHowever, this -- the opex, etcetera, and the cost to income have to kind of size down to more\nmanageable levels and better levels. So the -- my sense is next 2 quarters, 3 quarters, at least, we\nwill try to ensure that the current center meeting attendance of about 55% to 60% or 55% to 59%\nhas to go and go back to about 70%, 75%. And then from there on, we kind of take it forward.\nThat's number one.\nNumber two is the portfolio quality, which is customers in arrear, have to kind of be brought\nback to the current levels. And the customers, the sizable number of customers who've flown\ninto the GNPA bucket for whatever reason, for the right or the not so right reason, we have to\nensure that the recoveries fall in line, which is the one of the slides that -- or one of the graphs\nthat we put out in the investor presentation.\nSo that is something because when we look at the profile and the demographics of the customer\n, we are talking of customers with significant vintage -- who are obviously hard pressed on\nfulfilling their liabilities across all financiers. So they pick and choose. For example, we have a\ngood set of customers who pay only to us but don't pay to somebody else and likewise, it's the\nother way around as well.\nSo the customers also in these times when they are short on money, they are sequencing their\npayments, probably loans where, which are shorter and where their loan termination is around\nthe corner. They will first clear off that loan and then move over to the next financier. So that is\nwhat is happening at the customer side. But just to give you a softer input, around November is\nwhat we saw from a trend point and a customer from a trend and a customer engagement point\nof view.\nCustomers have started coming back in terms of engaging with our loan officers and branch\nmanagers in terms of when is the center meeting, when do I come, when -- how much is my\narrears. So they have started getting into those conversations because the new loans, obviously,\nthey are finding it difficult to get. So that's a good development, and that is where back to the\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nguardrail 1 and the guardrail 2, which is going to come in April. Yes, initially, it is a bit of a --\nbecause they are used to a particular way of operation, which obviously no more exists or that\nenvironment does not exist.\nSo 3 broad things before I conclude. First is discipline, JLG discipline, number one. Number\ntwo, employee welfare, very, very critical. You have to ensure that the employees are taken care\nof so that they hang around to lead your revival, that's number two. Number 3 is complete focus\non portfolio quality, which is making the customers aware about how they need to kind of ensure\nthat the credit worthiness is restored and maintained.\nAnd the fourth is taking care of the disbursements and the needs of the customer to ensure that\nthey are able to fulfill their business requirements. This is our focus and our priorities depending\non companies, the 1, 2, 3, 4 can be 3, 2,4, 1 or whichever way.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. This is very, very useful.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you. And Shreepal, I know you are on the call. You asked for that -- those questions. I\nhave the numbers now. So our national average is 97.84% on the x bucket. Bihar is 97.55%,\nKarnataka is 96.37%, Madhya Pradesh is 98.52%, Maharashtra is 98.84%.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question comes from Renish from ICICI. Please go ahead.\nRenish: Sir, my first question is on the net collection efficiency, which stood at 90.7%. If you can give\nsome insights on how this net collection is moving month-on-month and maybe December, how\nit is and can Jan maybe first 15 days. So if you can just share qualitative comments on that.\nAshish Damani: So hi Renish, so December number, like Shalabh said, is 97.8% and it was disclosed...\nRenish: No sir, I was talking about the net collection efficiency, not x bucket?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So the x buckets also, while we will give you -- we will -- from a trending point of view,\nwe are seeing while the -- there is a good movement of about 10% to 12% on the 1 to 30. That's\nnumber one. What Renish we are also seeing is, and it is actually a little bit of it -- while it's\ngood.\nThe customers who have moved into GNPA, this month, the net collection efficiency has really\ngone up because the customer has started paying back. While they will not come out of that\nGNPA bucket unless they clean up their loan, but that is another one. Specifics we can give --\nspecifics, if you want, we can kind of get into the buckets but from a trending point of view,\nRenish, what we are looking at is squeeze of the complete X bucket, which is what take this to\n99 and then you have the flows of 1% and then target of around 40% to 50% of recovery or\ncollection in the 1 to 30.\nAnd then the other or other -- the balance 50 bps kind of flows through or you make efforts to\nhold. But then that is something that you're going to afford to kind of just live with, that's part\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\none. Part two is, there is a lot of meat in the GNPA book at this point in time. We have a good\nabout almost -- we've done the analysis.\nWe have about -- for the book that we have, we -- even if we target a good number, and we are\ntargeting quarter 4 and quarter 1, a decent number. And we've given trends in the investor deck\nas well. That's something because we've either written off or they're in GNPA. So GNPA is 80%\nprovision, written off is 100%. So whatever comes is obviously a straight addition to the bottom\nline.\nRenish: Got it. Okay. So sir...\nShalabh Saxena: Want anything specific? Yes, specific you had asked about?\nRenish: No, sir. So I was just coming back to that point. So let's say, the net collection efficiency, which\nis 90.7% in this quarter. In a normalized scenario, ideally, where should this settle around 96%,\n97% or?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So, no 97% is a good number to target and 97% in the short term. And then ideally company\nshould try to go anywhere between -- operate anywhere between 97% to 98%. But that 97% to\n98% is probably two or three early quarters away. Even if we are able to take this number to\ngood in the short term from the current 90%, 91% to about 94%, 95% in the say, next 2 to 3\nmonths and then take that 95% to 97% by, say, end of quarter 1 of next year. I think that will be\na good trajectory to maintain, and then we hold on and then that's how with a slightly more\ncalibrated disbursement approach, I think this is a doable number for the team that we have on\nthe grounds.\nRenish: Got it. Okay. I'm just, again, hopping back on this question is, since you are mentioning that\nwe'll have a normalized quarter by Q2, which means this 91% should reach -- 97% by Q2. And\nhence, there should be at least a percentage point improvement in net collection efficiency over\nthe next 6 months. So are we seeing that kind of improvement in Jan or maybe the bulk of\nimprovement will happen back ended?\nAshish Damani: So Jan is stable. December, we have seen some improvement. Jan, we're seeing improvement in\n1 to 30 bucket as well as the NPA bucket, like Shalabh was explaining. Other buckets are more\nor less flat. But if the current bucket starts improving, starts going to 99%, then what you have\nto deal with is a finite bucket in the bottom that can be addressed with the measures that we have\ntaken on increasing number of people for the collection.\nShalabh Saxena: So Renish, let me just get into the specifics. Your question is a valid number. Instead of -- which\nare the states which are kind of dragging this and which are the states which are kind of pushing\nthe numbers up. The states like say, Maharashtra that I think Shreepal spoke about, states like -\n- we are hardly there in Haryana, but there are Bihar also for that matter. Bihar is pulling the\naverage down. Karnataka is pulling the average down at this point in time. Maharashtra is\ntrending very well, which is much, much above the national average.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nSo the approach that we are taking is obviously take every state one at a time because new things\ncome up every time. For example, you would be reading things about a particular state, which\nhas just kind of happened in the last 2 weeks. It will take another 2, 3 weeks, hopefully, to settle.\nBut broadly speaking, slowdown in Bihar from a lending perspective for various reasons that\nhave been discussed. UP is pretty okay. Maharashtra is okay. Karnataka should be okay in the\nnext 3 to 4 weeks at best.\nRajasthan is trending okay. These are the numbers that we have -- they will start hitting the 98\npoint -- the X bucket will start hitting the 99%, if not this month, the next month. And once that\nhappens, Renish, then it is a 3-month window where you kind of get the other buckets up. It is\nalways the 2 or 3 states, which I have mentioned, which we'll keep an eye on and then let's see\nhow this goes.\nRenish: Got it. And just last thing from my side on the Criss Financials. So I think in notes, you have\nmentioned that we have written off some INR50 crores. So I'm wondering what this write-off\npertains to?\nShalabh Saxena: This is the individual.\nAshish Damani: So Criss has a -- total INR750 crores of individual lending, where it's an unsecured lending, the\nborrower profile is just a notch higher than the microfinance borrowers. Largely the business is\nin Andhra Pradesh and Telangana this year. And as all of us are aware, Andhra actually had a\nmajor flood situation. And you've seen some slippages there. And thus, there is a write-off that\nhas come in.\nShalabh Saxena: So the LAP and the Nano that we launched about a year back is an INR180 crores book. That's\nalmost a cent percent book.\nModerator: The next question comes from Rajiv Mehta from Yes Securities.\nRajiv Mehta: Shalabh and Ashish, appreciate the company maintaining strong provision coverage on stage 2\nand stage 3 despite the higher flows. My first question is, with the significant increase in loss in\nQ3, in the sustained covanent features, would it force us to raise capital in the very near term\ndisregard of the market conditions, so as to get the confidence of the lenders back? And what\nare the ways of capital raise being evaluated and whether a promoter fee would commensurately\nparticipate in it?\nShalabh Saxena: So Rajiv, I'm not sure, I think you missed my commentary. And in fact, there is a point in...\nRajiv Mehta: Sorry, sorry, I joined the call late. I'm sorry.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. No. Fair enough. So I'll also give a reference to the -- to Slide 8 of our investor presentation.\nNevertheless, I'll answer your question. We had a Board today, and the Board has approved of\nequity raise of up to about INR750 crores, which is the confidence capital that you spoke about.\nAt this point in time, we are at about 35%, 36% of CRAR.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nSo technically and practically the balance sheet does not need capital because it is a very fortified\nand very strong balance sheet. However, from a confidence of all stakeholders, not just lenders,\nit's always good to kind of sit in a good position -- in a comfortable position. And hence, equity\nraise of up to INR750 crores has been approved, that we will evaluate, we will -- it's an enabler.\nThe mode, the time, etcetera, obviously, has been left to us and or as we start our journey, we'll\nkind of assess the situation and move accordingly.\nRajiv Mehta: And then Shalabh on the promoter contributing in that?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. We have their support.\nRajiv Mehta: Okay. And you also mentioned about the positive trends in collection efficiency and then the\nenabling factors, you mentioned that the center meeting attendance, which is a leading indicator\nhas seen some revival. You're talking about some improvement in loan officer attrition as well.\nCan you quantify the improvement that you're seeing in center meeting attendance in the loan\nofficer attrition?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So center meeting attendance, historically I mean, if I take out the last 2 quarters, 2.5\nquarters, if I look at FY '24 H2, and when we used to measure, it used to be about 65%, 60% to\n65%. And people keep on rotating. I mean, it's not that they will remain absent forever. So he\nwill attend one then miss the second one. That's where the 60% to 65% comes. And this was\nonce again pockets.\nGood pockets, we had upwards of 70% and even a 75% to 80%. Weekly obviously trends at\nabout 80%, 75% to 80%. But the last or rather this year, we have seen, say, during the elections,\nthe attendance go down to 50% or below that number as well. Now what we have started seeing\nis Rajiv, customers engaging with us on their payments, which earlier the engagement was\nslightly tepid. It wasn't really that enthusiastic.\nSo customers have started returning back asking details of time, asking details of loans, asking\ndetails for the repayments and so on and so forth. So this is a lead indicator, which also helps\nour people on the ground because we don't want them to be fighting with their hands tied. Once\nthe customer starts cooperating, that's the start of a good, healthy engagement with the customer,\nwhich kind of helps all of us in the long run from an industry point of view. So that is one.\nTwo is we are seeing, and I think I just answered Renish. We are seeing, even though the\ncustomer is in the GNPA bucket, we've seen hard numbers kind of increase from a collection\nefficiency point of view in the GNPA bucket. So those are the indicators where which kind of -\n- and I gave a long-ish answer to Shreepal also on this and Mahrukh in the initial stages where\nthe customer engagement on understanding her sequence of loans and what is the loan\noutstanding and how many loans are outstanding, how many installments are left for the tenure\nto be completed. All these questions, we have seen a tremendous increase at the branch level,\nwhich kind of gives us the confidence that the Guardrail 1 and even otherwise, a general\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\ndiscipline that the entire industry has been kind of enforcing and trying to bring about is yielding\nresults. Like always, these things take their own time.\nSo hence, July implementation of Guardrail 1 we are seeing effect in around November,\nDecember. Guardrail 2 when it comes in April, we'll have it own -- takes its own time. But long\nterm, I think, Rajiv, it's a good traction that we are seeing. And hopefully, the moment it\nsolidifies into a pure play trend, that is where we will kind of then move on.\nRajiv Mehta: Just one query I had on the collection efficiency. So I think for the whole quarter on a net and a\ngross basis, we have reported collection efficiency of 92% and 94% for the whole portfolio. And\nwhen you do the write-off, you would do the write-off at the end of the quarter, right? And\nyou've written off about INR700-odd crores of portfolio, so which is about 7%, 8% of the overall\nbook. And I would presume that this portfolio will be nonpaying completely. And hence,\nmathematically, does your collection efficiently from January onwards improve to 97%, 98%\non the current portfolio, which is on the books?\nAshish Damani: No. So, the current portfolio would not necessarily move into GNPA and write-off. And hence,\nI don't know if that math is straightforward the way you've said Rajiv. But yes, the -- we have\nbeen seeing at these customer levels, the improvement happening more month on month and\nthat's why that slide has been given on the current portfolio. Overall efficiencies, yes, I agree\nwith you. Once you take the write-off book away, the overall percentages should improve going\nforward.\nRajiv Mehta: Correct. So my question was on the overall number itself. Got it, Ashish.\nModerator: The next question comes from the line of Aviral Jain from Siguler Guff.\nAviral Jain: I have two questions. One is when you report the net collection efficiency for the quarter. So --\nand somebody mentioned on the previous question that you had INR677 crores of write-off on\nthe portfolio. So the denominator for the quarter included this written-off book as well. So and\nhence the net book that is left after the write-off will have better collection efficiency in the\nquarter going forward, assuming -- now the denominator has reduced and there's no further\nslippage. Is that the right way to look at it?\nAshish Damani: Aviral, the number given here is after the write-off. If we look at pre write-off the number will\nbe slightly lower. And we can give you that number offline.\nAviral Jain: Understood. And secondly, so given the collection efficiency trend what sort of -- and the book\nfrom a delinquent book perspective is looking very similar to the Q2 book, the Q3 ending book.\nSo -- and if the collection efficiency is not improving, can we assume or is it likely that we may\nsee a similar credit result or credit provisioning needed plus write-offs in Q4 as what we have\nseen in Q3?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So we are still on January 23, Aviral. And the reason while we are continuing to manage\nwhat we have on hand, it's very important for us to assess how do we chart the coming months\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nand quarters. So let me just detail. The fundamental of any organization is that you have to start\ndisbursing because it has to be -- it is a growth industry, you have to pursue growth. At the same\ntime, while all of us are cognizant that we have calibrated growth and not really a 30%, 40%\ntype of a growth. However, you have to start getting into that groove and channel of starting\nnormalized distribution. For you to be confident of getting into that channel of normalized\ngrowth, you have to be confident that the trends are improving and your money is safe. Your\ngood money is not going after bad money. So that's extremely critical. That's number two. We\nalluded in detail in -- about 2 or 3 questions we have said that we are seeing that trend.\nIt is still just one month trend, and January also seems to be trending on similar lines as\nDecember. So no real surprises. I hope we closed January, if not -- I mean, at least slightly better\nthan December. And if this continues, we will see -- we will -- another 2 months, 3 months, I\nthink we should be confident to say that now let us push the growth agenda.\nSo that being in the context, that being the context now to your question in terms of, yes, we are\nwhere we are, and we'll continue to manage the book, but however, very critical that we kind of\ntake decisions every quarter and every month, which have to maintain the balance sheet and\nbalance the balance sheet as well as kind of balance our agenda that we have for the enterprise.\nSo that's where it stands. And we'll see -- we'll evaluate, too early for us to really start plotting\nthe quarter or the next quarter for that matter.\nAviral Jain: Sure.\nModerator: Mr. Jain do you have any other question?\nAviral Jain: Yes, one follow-up question on that. So do we expect or are we seeing any forward flows from\nthe quarter end perspective? Or would we see -- even if the collection efficiency stay like where\nit is, it would mean that there is no further flow from where we are on the...\nAshish Damani: So Aviral, I'll take that one. Basically, what we were trying to explain earlier as well is your\nflows from the top have to kind of stabilize above -- I mean, below 1% level. So 99% once you\nget the collection efficiency. Then you have a normalized flow into 1 to 30 and subsequent\nbuckets. What we have right now is a very abnormal flow driven by many factors at industry\nlevel, some, let's say, Spandana's own doing. But once you have that 99%, then there is approach\nthat can be arrived to address all the other buckets.\nI think we are getting very close to addressing the first part, which is your current bucket. And\nas Shalabh was explaining, we have started working on the other buckets as well the hard buckets\nwhere we have already seen a lot of improvement. The middle one -- which is your Stage 2, I\nthink there also, we will get more time now given that we have added people. We have added\ncontrol teams.\nWe are going to address it in a more structural manner, even in the Stage 2 buckets. I think right\nnow, the team was struggling to bring discipline and a continuity to manage the current bucket\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nitself. I think that is now getting addressed and the improvement will start. We'll see -- we'll start\nseeing improvement in the subsequent buckets as well.\nModerator: The next question comes from Kunal Shah from Citigroup.\nKunal Shah: Yes. So firstly, with respect to the Spandana plus 3 and Spandana plus 4 and more. How is the\ncollection efficiency behavior out there, particularly in this portfolio? And how much is already\nthere into the Stage 2 bucket? And when we look at it now, given that we know in terms of\nwhich are these customers, how are we working with them because I think it's almost like 30%\nof our book?\nAnd if it doesn't get renewed or refinanced, there is, again, a risk of this flowing into the -- maybe\nflowing into Stage 2 Stage 3 and write-off. And even like from the earlier bucket, you could see\nsome moving because other players would refinance and we might not get a chance. So how\nshould we look at this and how industry players are now working with three and more lenders?\nAshish Damani: Yes. So the -- we are just pulling the numbers Kunal, while we speak. But in generic terms, I\nthink it is very difficult to say what the industry will do and how the customer would behave.\nBecause it's not like all the customers who are in, let's say, Spandana plus 4 are not paying. That's\nnot the case. Yes, they are punching above their weight.\nCompared to AUM, the delinquencies will be higher in those buckets. So for example, Spandana\nplus 4, I think in the GNPA, the contribution is about 25% compared to the AUM, which is at\n15.8%. So clearly, the weights are higher when you look at the delinquencies or the flows. But\nit's not like everything is into where the customers are not paying. The second point that you\nmentioned that as the guardrails kick in, people stop disbursing. So that disbursement, yes, will\nkick in and will reduce further. But it's not like today, everybody is disbursing to everybody as\na case. A lot of it -- I'm assuming is already played out where the liquidity has been curtailed to\ncustomers who are having, let's say, more number of loans. Yes, they are getting some loans,\nbut not like what probably was before the guardrails, the case was where people were not looking\nat it all together. I think some more of it will come, but lot of it has already played out in my\nmind.\nShalabh Saxena: So Kunal, just to kind of conclude and I mentioned this point earlier, whether you are a plus 3\nor a plus 1. The customer, given the implementation of the guardrail, will sequence her loan in\nterms of who to give first in case she is short on cash. If not, then obviously, she suffices her\nliability across the finances.\nIf not then, she'll sequence, but at the end, for her to qualify for a loan and get a loan, she has no\nreal option but to kind of ensure that the loans are cleared or the arrear buckets are cleared\neverywhere. So that's our take on slightly the next 3 to 6 quarters.\nKunal Shah: Yes. So the question largely was, as Ashish also highlighted, 15-odd percent of INR9,000 would\nbe closer to INR1,300-odd crores. And you mentioned like 25% of GNPA, which is hardly like\nINR100-odd crores. So when we look at it on this INR1,300 crores of Spandana plus 4 or equal\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nto 4, we just have like INR100-odd crores of GNPA, while I believe when most of the other\nplayers are sharing the collection efficiency, it seems like there, the collection efficiency would\nbe lower than 70-odd percent. So this can easily get added into the Stage 3 and should be more\nof a worry getting into Q1. So I was not very confident as to how this would stabilize in terms\nof the collection efficiency even in 6 months? Yes.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So you run that risk of either flowing into GNPA? Or -- and as Ashish mentioned, not\neverything which is a plus 4 is a GNPA. Yes, they are -- it is disproportionate to their\ncontribution, and that's the point I think you are also making in a different way. I think, yes, that\nwe'll have to wait for how things play out.\nBecause our sense is that the -- there's nothing structurally wrong with either the income levels\nin the markets that we operate or the customer intent because we'll just have to wait it out and\nsee how this thing goes. But the past history also is a testimony to the future. I think we should\nsee things improving from now on.\nGiven the fact that with no real depletion in incomes, it is now a pure play, her capability to pay.\nIf she has, she will give money to everybody, if not at best she'll sequence for her to get a fresh\nloan from anywhere.\nShalabh Saxena: The pain -- yes. So temporarily, somebody would -- some enterprise will have to bear that will\nhave to take it or will have to bear the pain. But eventually, I think it will stabilize. So my sense\nis that you will see and not just us, for everybody. We will see a lot of recoveries, a lot of money\nfrom recoveries flowing in, from GNPA pools and the write-off pools.\nKunal Shah: Okay. And when you look at it, one of the player was indicating that once we into the lesser\nleveraged customers or maybe just like three lenders, there could be some pressure on field as\nwell, okay? Because currently, larger part of the yield is also maybe driven by the customers\nwho have like more than four lender relationships. So do you think that could have a pressure\nover 2, 3 quarters in terms of yield structurally coming down for the industry?\nAshish Damani: Kunal, I think these customers are not that sensitive to the interest rates as such. And even when\nwe are speaking about the differential, the industry operates today in a very tight range of, let's\nsay, 22% to 24%, 25% at best. So the yield or the interest rate, I'm not very sure it will be a\ndriving thing for the customers to take that decision.\nYes, but loan amounts or for that matter, the ease of getting a loan or the timing, those definitely\nare some of the aspects which – or let's say, sometimes the customer is in the fag end of their\nloan with somebody. Probably they will be looking forward to repay that of first because they\ncan get a fresh loan from that entity. Those will be the driving points for such customers rather\nthan the interest rates.\nHaving said that, I think most of the institutions, including Spandana have a staggered interest\nrates where you would want to retain your good customers and thus you pass on the benefits on\nthe interest rate to customers in subsequent cycle. That is taken care of.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nModerator: The next question comes from Viral Shah from IIFL Securities.\nViral Shah: Shalabh, just wanted to basically again touch base on the question. But we are looking at\nSpandana plus 4 or more lender association. I understand, of course, there's a denominator\nimpact. But even if I adjust and look at it on an absolute basis, there is just INR40 crores quarter-\non-quarter decline, which is like 3%. And this is despite having a INR660 crores plus of write-\noff, right? So basically, does it mean that at an industry level, even the first guardrail is not being\nadhered to?\nShalabh Saxena: I'm not sure how -- you need a lot of data to come to that conclusion, Viral. So I'm not exactly -\n- maybe we'll take it offline in terms of understanding how you go to that number, but...\nViral Shah: Basically, what I've look at Shalabh is, see you had some INR10,000-odd crores AUM, right, as\nof October or September, right? Of course, that is the September number on the denominator\nside. But when I look at September AUM, and apply the 13.8% and then what is your AUM,\nwhich is INR8,900 crores something in this quarter and I applied the 15.8%.\nThe absolute decline is INR40 crores. This is after you having written off INR660 crores on the\nportfolio, right. That's how your AUM is at the end of this quarter. And when I'm saying is why\nis the industry not adhering to them, basically, who is lending to the customer, which by the first\nguardrail no one can lend to?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So look, I will answer -- I mean, I'll answer the second part, Ashish, in the meantime will\nanswer the first.\nAshish Damani: So one, this is not driven by AUM, these are like a number of borrowers. So it is not necessarily\njust the AUM part. It is also the count part.\nViral Shah: So then if that is the case, then basically people are lending even more to those borrowers. Does\nthat mean that?\nShalabh Saxena: So let me answer the second, which is the question that you are asking. Look, there is no choice\nof people who signed up this code of conduct with the association or the SRO. There is no option\nfor them not to follow. So it's a signed up document and it's a signed up agreement. And I do not\nhave as a company an option to follow or not follow. There could have been some and this\nincludes the banks, the universal banks, the SFBs, everybody, it's not just the NBFC or the\nNBFC-MFI. That's number one.\nNumber two, yes, there could be plus or minus in terms of instead of July, somebody would have\nimplemented it in August or September because of tech developments. It requires a lot of tech\ndevelopments and a lot of testing before you are ready. So I would -- Viral, I would say that give\nor take 15 days 10 days here and there, I would really be surprised if there's somebody who is\nnot following it. And at least we until now have not come up with a situation. There could be\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\ntechnical misses in an IT, in some company here and there, but not following brazenly -- I'm not\n-- I don't think so. Let's just say that.\nViral Shah: So Shalabh, you are saying it came from July, right? I'm looking at the number versus October.\nSo by October also, if no one is able to implement, then are we actually jumping the gun.\nShalabh Saxena: No, Viral, according to me, when you see the real impact in at least one to two quarters, you\nshould see it. You should just wait for about -- it operates with a lag, slightly with a lag. That's\nreason why I kind of dealt at length with why are the customers, what has happened that the\ncustomers are returning back to the center meetings? Why are the customers engaging with us?\nI do believe that everybody has kind of implemented it and maybe a clearer picture for all of us\nto see. And for all of you to see would probably be end of this quarter, but I have at least\npersonally not come across an instance where this has not been followed.\nViral Shah: Shalabh, again, on that point, can you give us like who are the -- like what number of MFIs,\nbanks, SFBs have been signatory to this MFIN guardrail 1 and how much AUM does that\nrepresent at an industry level?\nShalabh Saxena: So we can take it offline, Viral. I mean, obviously, I don't have the number handy -- but\npractically, it would cover minus the SHGs, I think it should cover everyone.\nViral Shah: Okay. Then the second -- next question relating -- again, on the data point. But more I would\nsay on this theme, is are we basically -- and when I say we, not specifically Spandana, so don't\ntake it in that sense. But as an industry, jumping the gun and saying that the worst is behind and\nDecember is showing improvement, because, see, by definition, X bucket collection efficiency\nhas to improve, right? After 9 months of pain, if you remove the delinquent customers, by\ndefinition, it has to improve.\nShalabh Saxena: Agreed. First of all, worst is behind is not a statement I have used ever. In this call or I won't and\nin fact -- no, no, fair enough. Fair enough. I'm sure somebody would have used it. I have been\nvery cautious in what I said. What I said and even our presentation says that. It says green shoots\nand it says early indications. Early indications when they solidify into a trend, which you have\nto give at least 3 to 4 months to thump your chest and say that it's going the way that we would\nhave liked to.\nAll we qualified was that December was decent, almost a 3.4, 2.4 uptick from the previous\nmonth. We have to wait for the trends to really be very sure of when when we kind of see the\nthings, where we can say that we are confident now we are the worst is past. So my guess is we\nhave to be slightly cautious on this. It is not a trend as yet. Another 2 months will really give\nyou a fair picture of, yes, the so-called worst is behind us. And now what you are left is this\nbucket, which you have to deal with, then you have to address those markets. But at least you\nget rid of your leaking bucket problem, which is currently we are facing.\nViral Shah: Fair enough, Shalabh. And just on your point, If the compliance, say, after, say, 6 months of the\nGuardrail 1 is what it is. How are we sure, say, we won't have this similar kind of problem, say,\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\na year down the line, of course, because everyone has a shorter memory in terms of when the\nthings normalize. How does one get that confidence, he won't be the similar situation, say, 1\nyear or 2 years down the line?\nShalabh Saxena: Look, so to each company its own. As far as we are concerned, we've obviously learnt our\nlessons in terms of what position to take, which geographies to expand and most importantly, it\nhas to do the biggest takeaway in this whole issue for the last 3 quarters has been how we deal\nwith our employees, how do we deal with their well-being, their careers, their recognition, their\nrewards and so on and so forth. That's number one. The second bucket is the customer bucket.\nObviously, these guardrails take care, at least structurally, the customer from a pureplay lending\npoint of view. Once you are assured of that bucket, then what is left is your employees and how\nyou kind of bring your attrition levels down to about 2%, 2.5% per month.\nThat's a more manageable attrition because that is the only gap that need -- that's a new thing\nwhich has come up in the last 3 quarters, which is good from an enterprise point of view and\nfrom a company's point of view because that is what you have to address. And once that is taken\ncare of and the structural initiatives take care of the customer behavior, I think we should be\ngood to go.\nViral Shah: Fair enough. And Shalabh, if I may, just one last question.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, yes, please.\nViral Shah: So basically, from -- of course, the 3 lender cap has been deferred to April. But when I then look\nat the overlap, the other 2 guardrails so as to say they have gone into implementation, right? And\nwhen I look at the overlap of MFI borrowers and them having non- MFI loans, so that nearly\nrepresents in aggregate to INR1.1 lakh crores, whatever you want to take it, the updated number,\nand that represents nearly 20%, 25% of the total MFI industry, right?\nSo if we are seeing this kind of pain for a customer who has, say, more than 3 or 4 loans, which\nare MFI loans, what about the customers who are so overleveraged ? And does it mean that say\ncustomers who just have three or more than three loans, your LGDs are at least in this cycle and\nimmediately in next 2, 3 quarters, the LGDs are going to be north of I would say, 90%.\nShalabh Saxena: Viral, so guardrail is a direction, which has been given. You need not stop at that. You can go a\nstep forward and restrict the borrowing by the criteria that you wish. In the examples that you\nquoted, the customers borrow from a lot of these fintechs, etcetera. So it is entirely upon the\nenterprise to kind of take a call in terms of any unsecured that you want to do. You will not do,\nwhether it is from an NBFC-MFI or whether it is outside.\nSo that is what each enterprise will be doing, like we have done. And we'll continue to do because\nfurther what has been pronounced is a bare minimum. And anything beyond that, it is the\nprudence and the risk taking appetite of the company, which will come into play. At this point\nin time, and I go back to the first question which was asked, at this point in time, it is better to\nerr on caution and probably continue this for at least 4 to 6 quarters before we really are confident\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nthat the absorption capacity of the household and I'm moving away from the customer to the\nhousehold is enough to kind of fulfill the liabilities, all the liability, borrowing liabilities that\nhave been taken. And likewise, the other way also, I presume for all the companies which are\nkind of lending, which are non-MFI, when they are lending to the household, they would be\nlooking at the household liability as well.\nSo the right thing to do is to look at the overall household liability, which all of us are doing,\nplus and then obviously, you can go down to whatever you want to whether you want to take the\nmobile phone loan that she would have taken, her husband would have taken as a liability and\nthen calculate the FOIR, etcetera, all of those things are a matter of the companies and the\nenterprises credit policy.\nModerator: Next question is from the line of Rajeev Jindal from Hero FinCorp.\nRajeev Jindal: So my question is -- all those were limiting my questions, although there has been discussion on\nthese numbers only till now. So my point or my question is that, so what are the recovery rates\nin the softer bucket, bucket 1 and bucket 2. And is there any improvement in the recovery rates\nin the last 3 months, if it is deteriorating? So what it was in September? And what are the\nnumbers as of now? So that is my question number one. I have another question.\nSo on the thing Spandana and the multiple lenders, the Spandana plus 1 and Spandana plus 2.\nSo like you have taken the numbers from the bureau scrub, so do you have any performance\nanalysis how these borrowers are performing with Spandana and with the other peer lenders?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, the second one, I'll answer, the first one, Ashish will answer. Do we have the number? Yes,\nwe have. But we don't really – there is a specific purpose, we don't really have the number handy.\nSeparately, we can connect and assess.\nRajeev Jindal: Okay. Okay.\nShalabh Saxena: First one was bucket 1 and bucket 2.\nAshish Damani: I mean, we have already given the current bucket efficiencies, Rajeev, we've talked about that\n97.84%, which is nothing but from the current bucket, the remaining is the flow. And the Stage\n2 normally hovers around -- what we have seen is prior to June was around, let's say, 45% to\n50% is now stacking at around 40%.\nRajeev Jindal: Okay. So this is constant for last, say, 3, 4 months, maybe for the last 6 months?\nAshish Damani: Yes. It is moving -- it will move maybe, 100 basis points plus or minus at best.\nShalabh Saxena: So Rajeev, this whole when you operate in these volumes, the most important thing is to stop\nyour leaking bucket. You have stop your X flows because once it flows, then it's only a question\nof what percentage, so which obviously is not the best situation to be in because you are\ncollecting also your loan officers job is not to chase the customer through the month. So that is\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nwhat it is. So it's always good to kind of be focused on the lead indicator, which is the X bucket\nand the other things are a matter of obviously the regular activity.\nModerator: Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for the day. I would now like to hand the\nconference over to the management for the closing comments.\nShalabh Saxena: So thank you, all of you to -- for having attended this and showing interest in our organization.\nThe company and the industry is obviously going through a slightly different phase, not the\nregular BAU. But given the trends that we have seen, we really hope that -- this works to\neverybody's advantage and most importantly, the customer's advantage because we deal with the\nsegment, which is the so-called bottom of pyramid. And it's very important that the household\nthere has a regular supply of formal credit at very reasonable rates to ensure that the income-\ngenerating loan that they take is put to good use. So that's the endeavor that we are in and all of\nus are in. So thank you for the interest, and thank you very much.\nModerator: Thank you. On behalf of Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited, that concludes this conference.\nThank you all for joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines.\n",

Thank you, and over to\nyou, sir.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you very much, Sagar. Good evening to all of you. Wishing all of you a very happy and\nprosperous New Year and a very happy in advance, the 76th Republic Day. The management\nteam at Spandana is thankful you for your interest in Spandana and for taking time out to join\nus on this call.\nMost of you would have gone through the quarter 3 results that have been uploaded on the stock\nexchanges a couple of hours ago. All of you are aware that since the beginning of the financial\nyear, the microfinance industry in India has been going through a slightly difficult operating\nenvironment, owing to a multitude of factors. However, before we dwell on those factors, let me\ntake a step back and give you a context of what was the strategy we at Spandana adopted and\nwhat were we trying to deliver through it. And then we'll come to the results. Way back in July\n2022, when we presented our Vision Document, we had identified a few key levers which we\nfelt were important for the company to grow sustainably. The first was geographic concentration.\nSpandana's portfolio was concentrated then in a few states, which was a key business risk.\nTo address this, Spandana expanded its presence in predominantly northern states like Bihar,\nUttar Pradesh and Rajasthan where we did not have a meaningful presence. As a consequence\nof this expansion, the share of top 4 states in our portfolio reduced from 57% then to about 50%\nby end of December '24.\nSo hence, we tried as per the articulated strategy, we tried reducing the concentration and\nspreading it across to the regions that we were not present, which was predominantly the\nNorthern region. Point number two, we are a firm believer that weekly is a better microfinance\nmodel giving the organization opportunity to engage few times in a year with the borrower. In\ntimes of stress, it is easier for the borrower to pay a smaller installment. All new microfinance\nbranches, hence, which we opened during the past 2 years have had a repayment schedule, which\nwas weekly.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nAnd by the end of December '24, these branches contributed about 14% to the AUM. And on a\nregular basis, about 20% to 25% on new disbursements. Parallelly, we also launched Project\nParivartan which was to move the existing borrowers who were in the monthly branches from\nmonthly repayment schedule to a weekly repayment schedule. However, we have identified and\nwe have been informing you that there were implementation difficulties on the field, which\nresulted in elevated flows from these branches.\nWe have paused Project Parivartan now, in fact, we did it a couple of quarters back. However,\nwe will pick this up in the next few quarters when the business stabilizes because we do believe\nthat weekly is the right model to go in the future. Point number three, muted ticket sizes, shorter\ntenures and customer acquisition-led growth have been the cornerstone of our growth strategy\nover the past 2 years.\nThe maximum ticket size that we offer is INR80,000 and the maximum tenure that we offer is\n24 months. We don't offer any loan beyond 24 months, and we do believe that in the\nmicrofinance environment, this is the right thing to do. While we added about 9 lakh new\ncustomers in FY '23 and about 14 lakh customers in FY '24, respectively, in the current financial\nyear, and we've kept you updated as well, we have slowed down our customer acquisition owing\nto the industry challenges and have added only about 3.3 lakh borrowers so far this year. This is\na part of design. This is a part of the articulated strategy that we have for this year, given the\nsituation that the industry is in and we are in. Now that brings me back to the challenges that the\nmicrofinance industry in India is going through in the current financial year.\nAs we had alluded to in our previous earnings call, there are a number of factors that are playing\nout simultaneously across the country. The first is branch staff level attrition across the industry.\nIt continues to remain elevated. Point number two, with easy availability of credit, many\ncustomers, many borrowers had availed loans from multiple institutions causing stress in their\nfinancial position. This has resulted in increased delinquencies across.\nPoint number three, post-COVID, there has been erosion of discipline amongst borrowers with\nfewer of them turning up for center meetings as compared to earlier. So there has been a drop in\nthe center meeting attendance over the past couple of years. Group cohesion has suffered as a\nconsequence resulting in individual door knock for collections, thus substantially increasing\ncollection pressure on the branch staff.\nPoint number 4 is the external influence, which is a mix of various localized as well as national\nlevel occurrences, which have happened over the past 3 quarters. This also includes the debt\nwaiver movements, and there are some local challenges in small pockets across states like\nKarnataka, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and few other states.\nIf you look at Slide 5 of the investor presentation, we have dissected the microfinance portfolio\ninto zones and clearly South India appears relatively better than North India. Most of our\nexpansion over the last 2 years was in North India, and this has added a dimension to our current\nperformance. Having said so, we do see green shoots emerging in December '24. We have a\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nslide on this in the investor presentation, but I'll kind of elaborate. Our current book, which is a\ncustomer who was standard or not in arrear, the net collection efficiency has shown a trend\nreversal in December.\nIn December, we saw 2.2% of flows from the X bucket, which is the current bucket into arrears,\nwhich has improved from 3.6% in November. So 3.6% flow has gone down to 2.2%. Any\nimprovement in current book indicates a smaller pool which flows into the subsequent buckets.\nAs this trend solidifies, we expect delinquencies and forward flows to reduce.\nAnd while we are already 22 days, today is the 23rd day of January, we continue to see the same\ntrend as we saw in December and probably slightly better in quite a few geographies. So if this\nsolidifies into a proper concrete trend, then I think we will be sure that the reversal has happened.\nPoint number two, efforts on the field to engage with branch staff has shown some improvement\nin attrition rate during the quarter.\nOur annualized LO and BM attrition was 60% and 30%, respectively. While I'm cognizant of\nthe fact that a 60% Loan Officer attrition is way beyond the expectation where in a normalized\nscenario, we were anywhere around 40% to 45%. However, we are taking steps to ensure that\nthe Loan Officer level attrition is curtailed. The Branch Manager attrition at 30% annualized is\nmore or less very near to the normal, which was about anywhere between 25% to 29%.\nAs we have highlighted in our previous calls, attrition leads to a disruption in the center meeting\nand borrower discipline because it's the Loan Officer and the old, seasoned Loan Officer who is\nable to drive all these initiatives and any new person taking this initiative, taking charge,\nobviously takes his or her own time to come up the curve. So that was the disruption that\nhappened.\nWe were impacted by this. However, things are improving now. This should hopefully have a\npositive impact in the coming quarters. Point number three, we've added a control layer in 75%\nof the branches and are seeing strong traction in branch process hygiene factors like center\nmeeting monitoring, customer engagement, following up for missed payments on due dates,\nchecking the CGT, GRT process, etcetera, are some of the many things that the control employee\nwhos stationed at the branches is supposed to be doing.\nWe've hired this layer for the last, and we've kept on increasing it for the last about 5 months, 6\nmonths, and we are seeing good results of it. We'll continue driving this and we will ensure that,\nsay, in the next 1 quarter, we will have all our branches manned by the branch quality manager.\nThe green shoots are encouraging, and we are doubling our efforts to strengthen business --\nstrengthen the business fundamentals, thus setting up the organization for future growth.\nAnother point which is very critical is the recovery from the delinquent pool. Recovery from\ndelinquent pool is one major focus area where we believe borrowers will repay as the stress\nabates and once the industry adopts the slightly tighter credit rules. On analysis of the delinquent\nportfolio, which is the GNPA pool and upwards, we have seen that a large portion of customers\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nare seasoned and vintage customers, who are probably not currently in a position to pay.\nHowever, their intent is okay.\nIt is an ability issue, it is a capability issue. We believe that a separate team engaging with them\nwould help us get the results on this pool. Hence, a dedicated recovery team of 600 has been\nfollowing up with the borrowers to recover dues. The team of 600 has just been beefed up and\nhas been increased. However, we are seeing an encouraging trend over the past 3 quarters with\nabout INR21 crores recovered in quarter 3 alone.\nThe trend has further continued in January, where the recovery so far has been equivalent to the\nfull month of December. So we are on track, and this is something that we will pursue for the\nnext minimum 4 quarters. We plan to take the count of dedicated recovery team to about 1,000\nby March '25.\nThe team is actively assisted by the various tele calling infrastructure who encourage borrowers\nto repay their dues and improve their credit record. While we had a team pursuing this portfolio\nuntil now, we are increasing the team size as we see more potential in the recoveries from this\npool in the coming quarters.\nAs the external situation improves, we want to be ready with enough capital to drive future\ngrowth. We have been maintaining about 17% of assets as cash and equivalents, which provides\nus with enough liquidity to meet all the organizational obligations. The capital position of the\ncompany is strong as is evident from the CRAR of 35.7%. The Board, taking in view the future\ngrowth has given an approval to raise up to INR750 crores of confidence capital. While we are\nin no immediate need of capital, however, considering the market conditions, the company will\nraise the said confidence capital at an appropriate time, and we will initiate the steps now.\nNow over to the results. The current trends, while they are encouraging and operations should\nnormalize, hopefully by end of quarter 2 of next year. Because we have not come across any\nstructural changes, either in the rural demand or long-term dip in the economic activity or the\nmacroeconomic outlook. Let me now move to regular business updates.\nBusiness drivers.\nDuring the quarter, the company adopted a cautious approach to lending. We followed a cautious\napproach because of the fluid situation in the market and hence had curtailed our disbursements\nconsiderably. Our disbursement for the quarter was INR1,443 crores, a Y-o-Y decline of 43%\nand a 5% quarter-on-quarter decline. AUM at the end of quarter 3 was INR8,936 crores\nregistering a decline of 14% Y-o-Y.\nThe AUM is an outcome of disbursements as all of us know, and we are confident that once the\ndust settles, we'll be back to driving growth. With the pause in customer acquisition in almost\nabout 800 branches and pausing onboarding new to credit borrowers, our total customer\nacquisition for the quarter was about 47,000 customers. The new business that we had launched,\nour LAP and Nano business, which we started a year ago under our subsidiary, Criss Financial\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nis growing steadily. During the last quarter, we crossed the 10,000 borrower milestone and an\nAUM of INR180 crores.\nThese products are offered in 6 states and across 105 branches. The portfolio quality under both\nthese products continues to be strong. We continue to believe in the strong market potential of\nthese products.\nNow we move to portfolio quality. We continue to maintain provisioning at 80%. We believe\nthis is among the highest in the industry. GNPA at the end of the quarter was 4.85%, an increase\nof 324 bps Y-o-Y.\nSequentially, the GNPA was flat. Likewise, our NNPA for the quarter was 0.98%, flat against\nSeptember of '24. On the liability and marginal cost of borrowing, including the borrowing mix.\nDuring the quarter, we borrowed INR872 crores. The borrowings were calibrated keeping in\nview disbursements and the organization's liquidity requirement. All of you are aware of the\nqualifying asset criteria that has to be maintained and hence, more prudence on the borrowing\nside.\nOur marginal cost of borrowing for the quarter was 12.2%, which was about 8 bps lower than\nthe previous year and about 41 bps higher than the previous quarter. Likewise, if I look at the\nborrowing mix, we now have a more healthy mix with banks contribution increasing to 55% at\nthe end of quarter 3.\nThe quarter 3 FY '25 financial performance. The net interest income for the quarter was INR265\ncrores over INR309 crores reported for quarter 3 of last year. NII was lower by 22% over the\nlast quarter. PPOP for the quarter was INR78 crores, which is down 67% Y-o-Y. The decline in\nPPOP was largely on account of shrinking loan book and increase in the opex because of the\nbench strength that we've created. Yield on the portfolio was down 291 bps Y-o-Y to 21.1%,\nyield declined by 128 bps over the previous quarter. And we'll cover in the various questions\nthat we get asked on the details of the yield. NIM for the quarter was 11.3%, down 195 bps Y-\no- Y. NIMs declined as a result of decline in yield and increase in the cost of borrowing. We are\nconsistently working towards improving our cost of borrowing. The company reported a net loss\nof INR440 crores for the quarter on account of higher provisions. We will once again, in the --\nduring the call, we'll break this INR440 crores to you so that you have a better sense of what\nwas the contribution into this INR440 crores.\nGiven the challenges, we'll continue to maintain a cautious stand until the green shoots solidify\ninto concrete trends. We are optimistic that the situation should normalize by end of quarter 1 or\nbeginning of quarter 2 of FY '26. We are maintaining an agile approach and are implementing\nsteps where necessary. We are also closely monitoring outcomes thereof. We continue to be\nprudent in our approach to lending, ensuring that our portfolio is well diversified, while staying\nconservative on ticket sizes and customer indebtedness.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nThe entire management team of Spandana is thankful for the consistent feedback that we have\nbeen receiving from all of you. This brings me to the end of my commentary. We look forward\nto your continued support, and we are ready for the questions.\nModerator: Thank you very much. Our first question comes from Mahrukh Adajania from Nuvama. Please\ngo ahead.\nMahrukh Adajania: So I just had a couple of questions that the new guardrails and one will be implemented in April\nas well. How will that put further pressure on asset quality in the first quarter? So you're talking\nabout things peaking out in the first quarter, right? Does that include the impact of any\nguardrails?\nOr how do we view it? That's my first question. And secondly, that growth will slow down. This\nwas a discussion at another call also. Growth will slow down post new guardrails. So what kind\nof AUM growth can we build for FY '26? I know longer term, it would pick up across the cycle.\nBut just for FY '26, because already, in the fourth quarter, we won't expect much growth. So on\nthe exit AUM, what is the kind of growth that we could build in? That's my next question.\nShalabh Saxena: So thanks, Mahrukh. Your first question was around guardrails. As we speak, we already, as an\nindustry, have implemented the guardrails one, which came into effect from July where there\nwere various criteria which were laid down on the guardrail one, of which the primary one was\nthe number of lenders, which was restricted to 4. So you can be the fourth, you cannot be the\nfifth.\nSo while, yes, in the short term, it does create an impact because if you go back to post-COVID\nfor the past 2 years, there have been instances where there were customers who were arrear and\ndelinquent with somebody else still getting loans with some companies where they either they\nhad a relationship or they didn't have. So that was the environment which the customers had\ngotten use to, which now obviously with the guardrail implementation and stricter enforcement\nof the -- what kind of customers you can acquire at -- from a delinquency or a DPD bucket level.\nI think it kind of in the long term helps restore some discipline across the industry, including the\ncustomers.\nSo it was a good thing to happen. And in spite of that, you are seeing that uptick, as I mentioned\nin December. And when I say uptick, it is across the industry. And I've spoken to a few people,\neverybody has experienced this trajectory going up. So yes, Mahrukh, and then in April, there's\na guardrail 2 coming where the number of lenders comes down from 4 to 3. Will it have an\nimpact?\nThe answer is, yes, in the short term, 110%. In the long term, however, you are back to bringing\ndiscipline to the customer. What it also does is that across 2 enterprises, if a customer is current\nwith somebody and and a delinquent or an arrear customer is somebody else, she will have to\nensure that her arrear account is clear for her to be eligible to borrow from any entity. There are\nrules in terms of the customer should not be more than 60 DPD if you have to give a loan,\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\netcetera. We've gone slightly ahead from -- instead of 60, we are saying we are getting it down\nto 30. And then I just answer this as to and I'll qualify why.\nWhat happens Mahrukh, is that in a situation as this, it is better to err on the side of caution\nrather than really kind of going overboard when it comes to deciding as to which customer to\nlend. And hence, to your second question on the growth and what will be the AUM. My guess\nis year '26 will be a mix of consolidation, discipline and growth. It will not just be a growth,\nnumber one.\nNumber two, because the first quarter, second quarter, there could be an impact. Either way,\nMahrukh, you are also aware. First quarter is typically a very mute quarter because companies\nlenders do get into the groove. There are -- the situation is such that the first quarter is never\nhigh on from the lender side as well. So it's a good time to kind of enforce this.\nAnd while we've kind of taken that extra step in terms of doing it now, but the industry, when it\nhappens in April, probably at best, well the customers will take about a quarter to kind of settle,\npost which then all customers will have to do is to be prudent and they'll have to balance their\nportfolio in terms of where to borrow and which loans to kind of conclude.\nSo yes, long answer to your question, but the answer is, we will as an industry, we will have to\nkind of take it as it is because this is a marathon. This is not a 100 meters or this is not a T20. So\nyes, it could impact 1 quarter even a 2 for that matter. But then long term, it's good. It'll build\nsustainability in the business, and it will help us. To your specific question in terms of what are\nwe targeting, I think we should -- I mean the year has still not ended. But I think a growth of\naround 15% is a good number to target from our year-end numbers. That's a good number.\nAnd then we'll see how the year progresses because when this year started, we did not know\nhow things were moving. We did not know what was coming. FY '26, obviously, we are better\nprepared. And it's always good to kind of be cautious. And if things improve quarter 3, quarter\n4, we will kind of relook at it. But at this point in time, I think a 15% exit number FY '26 of\nabout INR10,000 crores of AUM should be a good number to target.\nMahrukh Adajania: In the next quarter -- I mean, in the current quarter, the AUM will consolidate, right? Because\nthe focus is still on cleanup. Is that a fair view?\nShalabh Saxena: Your question is right. And the answer is, yes. The current focus of our company is to ensure we\nget the portfolio right. This year also has taught a lot of lessons to everybody, including us in\nterms of how much to grow, where to grow, which areas to target, which pockets to target. A\nbureau check at the time of loan is not the be all or end all, you have to keep track of the customer\nand so on and so forth. So lot of realignment will happen in terms of geographies. I mentioned\nin my commentary that South behaved slightly better than north. But does not mean it will\nbehave every time the same.\nSo you have to calibrate your strategies, basis – the customer experience and the customers\nrepayment behavior over these last 3 quarters. Once we have that, we will know exactly where\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nto grow. But as I say, the environment also has to kind of warm up to this whole new world. And\nI think I'm reasonably confident that 1 quarter or at best 2 quarters is good enough for things to\nstabilize and then we kind of move on.\nModerator: The next question comes from Shreepal Doshi from Equirus. Please go ahead.\nShreepal Doshi: My question was on the X bucket collection efficiency for states like Bihar, Karnataka and MP,\nwhich happens to be the key states for us. So if you can just highlight this kind of trend for these\nstates.\nShalabh Saxena: This is the X bucket collection efficiency, the 97.8%, that is in Slide 5 or 6. That's the one you're\ntalking about, right?\nShreepal Doshi: Yes, yes, that is for the whole company, right? I mean I'm talking about these three – four states.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, yes, yes. I got it. I got it. So Bihar is about 30, 35 bps lower. Karnataka this month, last\nmonth was okay, this month is experiencing a bit of -- and you would have read news about\nwhatever is happening. But that should settle because there is a lot of interventions. So that\nshould settle hopefully by end of this month. But Karnataka this month is clocking slightly about\n30, 40 bps lower than the number that you see. What were the other states, Bihar, Karnataka\nand...\nShreepal Doshi: MP and Maharashtra?\nShalabh Saxena: Maharashtra is okay, MP is okay. Yes, MP, Maharashtra are in -- I mean, give 5 or 10 bps here\nand there, they are almost clocking at the national average.\nShalabh Saxena: Bihar is trending a bit lower. That is very, very clear. The team says that this month, they catch\nup with the country. Currently, they are at a lower number. Karnataka last month was okay. This\nmonth is about 30, 40 bps lower. The other 2 states are just around the national average. Nothing\nof concern.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it. And sir, just one question was on this flow rates. So basically if you could highlight the\nPAR 0 number or PAR 1 to 30 DPD number for us for this quarter and for the last quarter\nbecause you highlighted 31 to 180 DPD, but if you could also give details about 1 to 30 DPDs\nnumber?\nShalabh Saxena: So, Shreepal, yes, Shreepal, the 1 to 30 number last quarter was about INR527 crores. This\nquarter, the closing number was about INR348 crores. So that number has been coming down.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it. That is helpful. Sir, second question was on this -- we've not been able to meet the RBI\nrequirement of 75% for microfinance loans. If you could just give some clarification on that\nparticular aspect?\nShalabh Saxena: Shreepal, the qualifying assets is a metric which needs to be met. I'm sure it's on the balance\nsheet level, you have to have 75% of your lending to be qualifying assets. Now in the current\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nsituation, we had deliberately slowed down the disbursements. That had an impact on the\nqualifying assets. Plus we have been holding cash on the balance sheet, which obviously then as\na percentage became higher than whatever the threshold could have been at the end of this thing.\nSo these metrics in the current situation, go for a toss for a little bit, and we are already working\nwith the regulator on the aspect.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it, sir. Got it. Sir, just one last question was on branch expansion side. So while we are going\nthrough turbulent times on maintaining our books, what is the reason or what is the thought\nprocess behind adding these branches even during this quarter? And I see that the branches that\nyou added, large number is in the -- based on monthly collection model?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Shreepal, we -- these branches that you're talking about are split branches. They are not\n-- I mean, while they are technically new branches, but when a portfolio grows beyond INR10\ncrores INR12 crores, that is beyond the threshold of our comfort because it becomes difficult to\nmanage. So all the new branches that we have opened this year, this entire year, not just this\nquarter, are all split branches. This year, by end of the year, I think we should have about 105 or\n106 new branches, but all of them will be split. They are not absolutely brand new. They come\nwith the portfolio already.\nModerator: The next question comes from Abhijit Tibrewal from Motilal Oswal.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: So my first question is given that there are green shoots now in December, and you said that\nthings are looking similar in January. Based on your conversations, do you think is there an\noutside chance that the implementation of the MFIN guardrail 2.0 can be permanently deferred?\nShalabh Saxena: No. So Abhijit, look, I can't speak for MFIN. We have given our position clearly. And there is\nno reason to not believe whatever deadline that MFIN has given. So it has been deferred from\nJanuary to April. As far as we are concerned, we've gone that extra mile. I think we've put it out\n-- put out a slide and we have a section in the slide where we say that we will restrict ourselves\nto 3 lenders.\nObviously, it's purely internal and voluntary because we do believe that it's important to take\nthese slightly more tighter norms. I know there will be an impact. There will be a higher\nrejection. But at this stage, I think we have to ward this time by being overcautious rather than\ngoing the other way. So as far as we are concerned, we are already in line.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. And then a related question on one of the slides, you've given out the lender overlap, the\nSpandana, Spandana plus 1, 2, 3, 4. So intuitively one would have thought that given that\nguardrails 1.0 had already been implemented, the customers with Spandana plus 4 or Spandana\ngreater than 4 could have come down. Is there a denominator effect that we are seeing that 13.8%\nin October has moved to 15.8%?\nAshish Damani: Yes, absolutely right, Abhijit. So there are 2 metrics which are pushing the number higher. One\nis the denominator because the customers who are paying off falling off from the numbers clearly\nimpacts this. The second is if you know our existing customers who are there at, let's say\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nSpandana plus 3 or whatever and have taken a loan. Then probably there is another reason why\nthe numbers will slip from the higher rows into the lower rows.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Sir, but now that as an industry, no one is giving loans to the customers who have four loans\nalready, right? Then how are some of these customers able to get a fresh loan?\nShalabh Saxena: No, no. What is the guardrail 1, you cannot be the fifth lender. You can be the fourth lender. The\nentire industry, still not every customer has already reached the brim. So there are customers at\nvarious stages. And they will progress towards whichever way.\nSo the loans are there. It is just that -- see it is a credit demand, high demand segment, where the\nday you want to switch on the loan tap, it will start coming. At this stage, obviously, in spite of\nthe eligibility of the customer, at least I speak for ourselves, we are being cautious. And likewise,\nthere are few more who are cautious.\nSo it is not about whether customers are able to take a loan or not. It is about how much is the\nwillingness of the lender in this situation to kind of go overboard on the lending side. So it's a\ntough one, Abhijit, but I guess this should be -- we have to wait it out for 1 quarter, 1.5 and then\nlet's see how things go.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. And just one last question for you. And Ashish, sir. Sir, I mean you said that by end of\n1Q or early 2Q things should normalize. Given that, I mean, we are seeing some green shoots in\nthe sector. Add to that the fact that maybe April onwards when MFIN guardrails 2.0 get\nimplemented. So next 6 months, how should the trend be is what I'm kind of trying to\nunderstand?\nHave you been able to get some handle on what could be the credit cost now over the next couple\nof quarters? And for you, Ashish, sir, I mean, while we've managed to keep our GNPA number\nat almost same levels as last quarter. Except GNPAs, have there been any other covenant\nbreaches that you have seen?\nAshish Damani: So I'll answer first. There have not been any other breaches that we have seen. It's all related to\nquarterly profitability that we had and the tangible net worth bit, which is obviously records,\neven the write-offs is taken into the consideration. So that is how those are the 2, but otherwise,\nnothing else.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: And Shalabh sir, my first question where I asked how the next 6 months are going to trend, given\nwhat we've seen in December and January? And if we are...\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Abhijit, I was just in the process of -- and after I finish your question, there was a\nquestion that Shreepal had asked, which I had kind of given an approximate answer. I have the\nanswer. So I'll give that answer after I'll finish your question. So the next 6 months, I'll just\nstretch it 2Q which is this quarter and the Q1, and I'll add the Q2 as well of next year.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nMy guess is that one should kind of just hold the fort on the ongoing -- the disbursements have\nto start. The disbursement story has to start, goes without saying because you have to meet the\ncustomer demand, but you have to do cherry picking as far as your customers are concerned.\nThat's number one. Number two is, the portfolio quality and driving the discipline.\nThis is, in fact, should have been number one, which is driving the center meeting discipline in\nthe JLG model that most of the industry follows. It is extremely critical that this door knock\nmodel, which is the customers being difficult in terms of attending the center meetings has to be\nkind of curtailed and we have to ensure that the customer comes and turns up at the center\nmeeting because door knock is a very inefficient way of operating this model. And frankly, for\nthe number of customers that all of us deal with, we are at about some almost 3 million\ncustomers. Even a 10% is a good, good number, which is very difficult to manage. So not a\nviable model from an employee stress perspective and even operational efficiency. So because\nright now, while we are preparing our powder for the next 2 quarters on the growth side.\nHowever, this -- the opex, etcetera, and the cost to income have to kind of size down to more\nmanageable levels and better levels. So the -- my sense is next 2 quarters, 3 quarters, at least, we\nwill try to ensure that the current center meeting attendance of about 55% to 60% or 55% to 59%\nhas to go and go back to about 70%, 75%. And then from there on, we kind of take it forward.\nThat's number one.\nNumber two is the portfolio quality, which is customers in arrear, have to kind of be brought\nback to the current levels. And the customers, the sizable number of customers who've flown\ninto the GNPA bucket for whatever reason, for the right or the not so right reason, we have to\nensure that the recoveries fall in line, which is the one of the slides that -- or one of the graphs\nthat we put out in the investor presentation.\nSo that is something because when we look at the profile and the demographics of the customer\n, we are talking of customers with significant vintage -- who are obviously hard pressed on\nfulfilling their liabilities across all financiers. So they pick and choose. For example, we have a\ngood set of customers who pay only to us but don't pay to somebody else and likewise, it's the\nother way around as well.\nSo the customers also in these times when they are short on money, they are sequencing their\npayments, probably loans where, which are shorter and where their loan termination is around\nthe corner. They will first clear off that loan and then move over to the next financier. So that is\nwhat is happening at the customer side. But just to give you a softer input, around November is\nwhat we saw from a trend point and a customer from a trend and a customer engagement point\nof view.\nCustomers have started coming back in terms of engaging with our loan officers and branch\nmanagers in terms of when is the center meeting, when do I come, when -- how much is my\narrears. So they have started getting into those conversations because the new loans, obviously,\nthey are finding it difficult to get. So that's a good development, and that is where back to the\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nguardrail 1 and the guardrail 2, which is going to come in April. Yes, initially, it is a bit of a --\nbecause they are used to a particular way of operation, which obviously no more exists or that\nenvironment does not exist.\nSo 3 broad things before I conclude. First is discipline, JLG discipline, number one. Number\ntwo, employee welfare, very, very critical. You have to ensure that the employees are taken care\nof so that they hang around to lead your revival, that's number two. Number 3 is complete focus\non portfolio quality, which is making the customers aware about how they need to kind of ensure\nthat the credit worthiness is restored and maintained.\nAnd the fourth is taking care of the disbursements and the needs of the customer to ensure that\nthey are able to fulfill their business requirements. This is our focus and our priorities depending\non companies, the 1, 2, 3, 4 can be 3, 2,4, 1 or whichever way.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. This is very, very useful.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you. And Shreepal, I know you are on the call. You asked for that -- those questions. I\nhave the numbers now. So our national average is 97.84% on the x bucket. Bihar is 97.55%,\nKarnataka is 96.37%, Madhya Pradesh is 98.52%, Maharashtra is 98.84%.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question comes from Renish from ICICI. Please go ahead.\nRenish: Sir, my first question is on the net collection efficiency, which stood at 90.7%. If you can give\nsome insights on how this net collection is moving month-on-month and maybe December, how\nit is and can Jan maybe first 15 days. So if you can just share qualitative comments on that.\nAshish Damani: So hi Renish, so December number, like Shalabh said, is 97.8% and it was disclosed...\nRenish: No sir, I was talking about the net collection efficiency, not x bucket?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So the x buckets also, while we will give you -- we will -- from a trending point of view,\nwe are seeing while the -- there is a good movement of about 10% to 12% on the 1 to 30. That's\nnumber one. What Renish we are also seeing is, and it is actually a little bit of it -- while it's\ngood.\nThe customers who have moved into GNPA, this month, the net collection efficiency has really\ngone up because the customer has started paying back. While they will not come out of that\nGNPA bucket unless they clean up their loan, but that is another one. Specifics we can give --\nspecifics, if you want, we can kind of get into the buckets but from a trending point of view,\nRenish, what we are looking at is squeeze of the complete X bucket, which is what take this to\n99 and then you have the flows of 1% and then target of around 40% to 50% of recovery or\ncollection in the 1 to 30.\nAnd then the other or other -- the balance 50 bps kind of flows through or you make efforts to\nhold. But then that is something that you're going to afford to kind of just live with, that's part\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\none. Part two is, there is a lot of meat in the GNPA book at this point in time. We have a good\nabout almost -- we've done the analysis.\nWe have about -- for the book that we have, we -- even if we target a good number, and we are\ntargeting quarter 4 and quarter 1, a decent number. And we've given trends in the investor deck\nas well. That's something because we've either written off or they're in GNPA. So GNPA is 80%\nprovision, written off is 100%. So whatever comes is obviously a straight addition to the bottom\nline.\nRenish: Got it. Okay. So sir...\nShalabh Saxena: Want anything specific? Yes, specific you had asked about?\nRenish: No, sir. So I was just coming back to that point. So let's say, the net collection efficiency, which\nis 90.7% in this quarter. In a normalized scenario, ideally, where should this settle around 96%,\n97% or?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So, no 97% is a good number to target and 97% in the short term. And then ideally company\nshould try to go anywhere between -- operate anywhere between 97% to 98%. But that 97% to\n98% is probably two or three early quarters away. Even if we are able to take this number to\ngood in the short term from the current 90%, 91% to about 94%, 95% in the say, next 2 to 3\nmonths and then take that 95% to 97% by, say, end of quarter 1 of next year. I think that will be\na good trajectory to maintain, and then we hold on and then that's how with a slightly more\ncalibrated disbursement approach, I think this is a doable number for the team that we have on\nthe grounds.\nRenish: Got it. Okay. I'm just, again, hopping back on this question is, since you are mentioning that\nwe'll have a normalized quarter by Q2, which means this 91% should reach -- 97% by Q2. And\nhence, there should be at least a percentage point improvement in net collection efficiency over\nthe next 6 months. So are we seeing that kind of improvement in Jan or maybe the bulk of\nimprovement will happen back ended?\nAshish Damani: So Jan is stable. December, we have seen some improvement. Jan, we're seeing improvement in\n1 to 30 bucket as well as the NPA bucket, like Shalabh was explaining. Other buckets are more\nor less flat. But if the current bucket starts improving, starts going to 99%, then what you have\nto deal with is a finite bucket in the bottom that can be addressed with the measures that we have\ntaken on increasing number of people for the collection.\nShalabh Saxena: So Renish, let me just get into the specifics. Your question is a valid number. Instead of -- which\nare the states which are kind of dragging this and which are the states which are kind of pushing\nthe numbers up. The states like say, Maharashtra that I think Shreepal spoke about, states like -\n- we are hardly there in Haryana, but there are Bihar also for that matter. Bihar is pulling the\naverage down. Karnataka is pulling the average down at this point in time. Maharashtra is\ntrending very well, which is much, much above the national average.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nSo the approach that we are taking is obviously take every state one at a time because new things\ncome up every time. For example, you would be reading things about a particular state, which\nhas just kind of happened in the last 2 weeks. It will take another 2, 3 weeks, hopefully, to settle.\nBut broadly speaking, slowdown in Bihar from a lending perspective for various reasons that\nhave been discussed. UP is pretty okay. Maharashtra is okay. Karnataka should be okay in the\nnext 3 to 4 weeks at best.\nRajasthan is trending okay. These are the numbers that we have -- they will start hitting the 98\npoint -- the X bucket will start hitting the 99%, if not this month, the next month. And once that\nhappens, Renish, then it is a 3-month window where you kind of get the other buckets up. It is\nalways the 2 or 3 states, which I have mentioned, which we'll keep an eye on and then let's see\nhow this goes.\nRenish: Got it. And just last thing from my side on the Criss Financials. So I think in notes, you have\nmentioned that we have written off some INR50 crores. So I'm wondering what this write-off\npertains to?\nShalabh Saxena: This is the individual.\nAshish Damani: So Criss has a -- total INR750 crores of individual lending, where it's an unsecured lending, the\nborrower profile is just a notch higher than the microfinance borrowers. Largely the business is\nin Andhra Pradesh and Telangana this year. And as all of us are aware, Andhra actually had a\nmajor flood situation. And you've seen some slippages there. And thus, there is a write-off that\nhas come in.\nShalabh Saxena: So the LAP and the Nano that we launched about a year back is an INR180 crores book. That's\nalmost a cent percent book.\nModerator: The next question comes from Rajiv Mehta from Yes Securities.\nRajiv Mehta: Shalabh and Ashish, appreciate the company maintaining strong provision coverage on stage 2\nand stage 3 despite the higher flows. My first question is, with the significant increase in loss in\nQ3, in the sustained covanent features, would it force us to raise capital in the very near term\ndisregard of the market conditions, so as to get the confidence of the lenders back? And what\nare the ways of capital raise being evaluated and whether a promoter fee would commensurately\nparticipate in it?\nShalabh Saxena: So Rajiv, I'm not sure, I think you missed my commentary. And in fact, there is a point in...\nRajiv Mehta: Sorry, sorry, I joined the call late. I'm sorry.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. No. Fair enough. So I'll also give a reference to the -- to Slide 8 of our investor presentation.\nNevertheless, I'll answer your question. We had a Board today, and the Board has approved of\nequity raise of up to about INR750 crores, which is the confidence capital that you spoke about.\nAt this point in time, we are at about 35%, 36% of CRAR.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nSo technically and practically the balance sheet does not need capital because it is a very fortified\nand very strong balance sheet. However, from a confidence of all stakeholders, not just lenders,\nit's always good to kind of sit in a good position -- in a comfortable position. And hence, equity\nraise of up to INR750 crores has been approved, that we will evaluate, we will -- it's an enabler.\nThe mode, the time, etcetera, obviously, has been left to us and or as we start our journey, we'll\nkind of assess the situation and move accordingly.\nRajiv Mehta: And then Shalabh on the promoter contributing in that?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. We have their support.\nRajiv Mehta: Okay. And you also mentioned about the positive trends in collection efficiency and then the\nenabling factors, you mentioned that the center meeting attendance, which is a leading indicator\nhas seen some revival. You're talking about some improvement in loan officer attrition as well.\nCan you quantify the improvement that you're seeing in center meeting attendance in the loan\nofficer attrition?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So center meeting attendance, historically I mean, if I take out the last 2 quarters, 2.5\nquarters, if I look at FY '24 H2, and when we used to measure, it used to be about 65%, 60% to\n65%. And people keep on rotating. I mean, it's not that they will remain absent forever. So he\nwill attend one then miss the second one. That's where the 60% to 65% comes. And this was\nonce again pockets.\nGood pockets, we had upwards of 70% and even a 75% to 80%. Weekly obviously trends at\nabout 80%, 75% to 80%. But the last or rather this year, we have seen, say, during the elections,\nthe attendance go down to 50% or below that number as well. Now what we have started seeing\nis Rajiv, customers engaging with us on their payments, which earlier the engagement was\nslightly tepid. It wasn't really that enthusiastic.\nSo customers have started returning back asking details of time, asking details of loans, asking\ndetails for the repayments and so on and so forth. So this is a lead indicator, which also helps\nour people on the ground because we don't want them to be fighting with their hands tied. Once\nthe customer starts cooperating, that's the start of a good, healthy engagement with the customer,\nwhich kind of helps all of us in the long run from an industry point of view. So that is one.\nTwo is we are seeing, and I think I just answered Renish. We are seeing, even though the\ncustomer is in the GNPA bucket, we've seen hard numbers kind of increase from a collection\nefficiency point of view in the GNPA bucket. So those are the indicators where which kind of -\n- and I gave a long-ish answer to Shreepal also on this and Mahrukh in the initial stages where\nthe customer engagement on understanding her sequence of loans and what is the loan\noutstanding and how many loans are outstanding, how many installments are left for the tenure\nto be completed. All these questions, we have seen a tremendous increase at the branch level,\nwhich kind of gives us the confidence that the Guardrail 1 and even otherwise, a general\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\ndiscipline that the entire industry has been kind of enforcing and trying to bring about is yielding\nresults. Like always, these things take their own time.\nSo hence, July implementation of Guardrail 1 we are seeing effect in around November,\nDecember. Guardrail 2 when it comes in April, we'll have it own -- takes its own time. But long\nterm, I think, Rajiv, it's a good traction that we are seeing. And hopefully, the moment it\nsolidifies into a pure play trend, that is where we will kind of then move on.\nRajiv Mehta: Just one query I had on the collection efficiency. So I think for the whole quarter on a net and a\ngross basis, we have reported collection efficiency of 92% and 94% for the whole portfolio. And\nwhen you do the write-off, you would do the write-off at the end of the quarter, right? And\nyou've written off about INR700-odd crores of portfolio, so which is about 7%, 8% of the overall\nbook. And I would presume that this portfolio will be nonpaying completely. And hence,\nmathematically, does your collection efficiently from January onwards improve to 97%, 98%\non the current portfolio, which is on the books?\nAshish Damani: No. So, the current portfolio would not necessarily move into GNPA and write-off. And hence,\nI don't know if that math is straightforward the way you've said Rajiv. But yes, the -- we have\nbeen seeing at these customer levels, the improvement happening more month on month and\nthat's why that slide has been given on the current portfolio. Overall efficiencies, yes, I agree\nwith you. Once you take the write-off book away, the overall percentages should improve going\nforward.\nRajiv Mehta: Correct. So my question was on the overall number itself. Got it, Ashish.\nModerator: The next question comes from the line of Aviral Jain from Siguler Guff.\nAviral Jain: I have two questions. One is when you report the net collection efficiency for the quarter. So --\nand somebody mentioned on the previous question that you had INR677 crores of write-off on\nthe portfolio. So the denominator for the quarter included this written-off book as well. So and\nhence the net book that is left after the write-off will have better collection efficiency in the\nquarter going forward, assuming -- now the denominator has reduced and there's no further\nslippage. Is that the right way to look at it?\nAshish Damani: Aviral, the number given here is after the write-off. If we look at pre write-off the number will\nbe slightly lower. And we can give you that number offline.\nAviral Jain: Understood. And secondly, so given the collection efficiency trend what sort of -- and the book\nfrom a delinquent book perspective is looking very similar to the Q2 book, the Q3 ending book.\nSo -- and if the collection efficiency is not improving, can we assume or is it likely that we may\nsee a similar credit result or credit provisioning needed plus write-offs in Q4 as what we have\nseen in Q3?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So we are still on January 23, Aviral. And the reason while we are continuing to manage\nwhat we have on hand, it's very important for us to assess how do we chart the coming months\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nand quarters. So let me just detail. The fundamental of any organization is that you have to start\ndisbursing because it has to be -- it is a growth industry, you have to pursue growth. At the same\ntime, while all of us are cognizant that we have calibrated growth and not really a 30%, 40%\ntype of a growth. However, you have to start getting into that groove and channel of starting\nnormalized distribution. For you to be confident of getting into that channel of normalized\ngrowth, you have to be confident that the trends are improving and your money is safe. Your\ngood money is not going after bad money. So that's extremely critical. That's number two. We\nalluded in detail in -- about 2 or 3 questions we have said that we are seeing that trend.\nIt is still just one month trend, and January also seems to be trending on similar lines as\nDecember. So no real surprises. I hope we closed January, if not -- I mean, at least slightly better\nthan December. And if this continues, we will see -- we will -- another 2 months, 3 months, I\nthink we should be confident to say that now let us push the growth agenda.\nSo that being in the context, that being the context now to your question in terms of, yes, we are\nwhere we are, and we'll continue to manage the book, but however, very critical that we kind of\ntake decisions every quarter and every month, which have to maintain the balance sheet and\nbalance the balance sheet as well as kind of balance our agenda that we have for the enterprise.\nSo that's where it stands. And we'll see -- we'll evaluate, too early for us to really start plotting\nthe quarter or the next quarter for that matter.\nAviral Jain: Sure.\nModerator: Mr. Jain do you have any other question?\nAviral Jain: Yes, one follow-up question on that. So do we expect or are we seeing any forward flows from\nthe quarter end perspective? Or would we see -- even if the collection efficiency stay like where\nit is, it would mean that there is no further flow from where we are on the...\nAshish Damani: So Aviral, I'll take that one. Basically, what we were trying to explain earlier as well is your\nflows from the top have to kind of stabilize above -- I mean, below 1% level. So 99% once you\nget the collection efficiency. Then you have a normalized flow into 1 to 30 and subsequent\nbuckets. What we have right now is a very abnormal flow driven by many factors at industry\nlevel, some, let's say, Spandana's own doing. But once you have that 99%, then there is approach\nthat can be arrived to address all the other buckets.\nI think we are getting very close to addressing the first part, which is your current bucket. And\nas Shalabh was explaining, we have started working on the other buckets as well the hard buckets\nwhere we have already seen a lot of improvement. The middle one -- which is your Stage 2, I\nthink there also, we will get more time now given that we have added people. We have added\ncontrol teams.\nWe are going to address it in a more structural manner, even in the Stage 2 buckets. I think right\nnow, the team was struggling to bring discipline and a continuity to manage the current bucket\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nitself. I think that is now getting addressed and the improvement will start. We'll see -- we'll start\nseeing improvement in the subsequent buckets as well.\nModerator: The next question comes from Kunal Shah from Citigroup.\nKunal Shah: Yes. So firstly, with respect to the Spandana plus 3 and Spandana plus 4 and more. How is the\ncollection efficiency behavior out there, particularly in this portfolio? And how much is already\nthere into the Stage 2 bucket? And when we look at it now, given that we know in terms of\nwhich are these customers, how are we working with them because I think it's almost like 30%\nof our book?\nAnd if it doesn't get renewed or refinanced, there is, again, a risk of this flowing into the -- maybe\nflowing into Stage 2 Stage 3 and write-off. And even like from the earlier bucket, you could see\nsome moving because other players would refinance and we might not get a chance. So how\nshould we look at this and how industry players are now working with three and more lenders?\nAshish Damani: Yes. So the -- we are just pulling the numbers Kunal, while we speak. But in generic terms, I\nthink it is very difficult to say what the industry will do and how the customer would behave.\nBecause it's not like all the customers who are in, let's say, Spandana plus 4 are not paying. That's\nnot the case. Yes, they are punching above their weight.\nCompared to AUM, the delinquencies will be higher in those buckets. So for example, Spandana\nplus 4, I think in the GNPA, the contribution is about 25% compared to the AUM, which is at\n15.8%. So clearly, the weights are higher when you look at the delinquencies or the flows. But\nit's not like everything is into where the customers are not paying. The second point that you\nmentioned that as the guardrails kick in, people stop disbursing. So that disbursement, yes, will\nkick in and will reduce further. But it's not like today, everybody is disbursing to everybody as\na case. A lot of it -- I'm assuming is already played out where the liquidity has been curtailed to\ncustomers who are having, let's say, more number of loans. Yes, they are getting some loans,\nbut not like what probably was before the guardrails, the case was where people were not looking\nat it all together. I think some more of it will come, but lot of it has already played out in my\nmind.\nShalabh Saxena: So Kunal, just to kind of conclude and I mentioned this point earlier, whether you are a plus 3\nor a plus 1. The customer, given the implementation of the guardrail, will sequence her loan in\nterms of who to give first in case she is short on cash. If not, then obviously, she suffices her\nliability across the finances.\nIf not then, she'll sequence, but at the end, for her to qualify for a loan and get a loan, she has no\nreal option but to kind of ensure that the loans are cleared or the arrear buckets are cleared\neverywhere. So that's our take on slightly the next 3 to 6 quarters.\nKunal Shah: Yes. So the question largely was, as Ashish also highlighted, 15-odd percent of INR9,000 would\nbe closer to INR1,300-odd crores. And you mentioned like 25% of GNPA, which is hardly like\nINR100-odd crores. So when we look at it on this INR1,300 crores of Spandana plus 4 or equal\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nto 4, we just have like INR100-odd crores of GNPA, while I believe when most of the other\nplayers are sharing the collection efficiency, it seems like there, the collection efficiency would\nbe lower than 70-odd percent. So this can easily get added into the Stage 3 and should be more\nof a worry getting into Q1. So I was not very confident as to how this would stabilize in terms\nof the collection efficiency even in 6 months? Yes.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So you run that risk of either flowing into GNPA? Or -- and as Ashish mentioned, not\neverything which is a plus 4 is a GNPA. Yes, they are -- it is disproportionate to their\ncontribution, and that's the point I think you are also making in a different way. I think, yes, that\nwe'll have to wait for how things play out.\nBecause our sense is that the -- there's nothing structurally wrong with either the income levels\nin the markets that we operate or the customer intent because we'll just have to wait it out and\nsee how this thing goes. But the past history also is a testimony to the future. I think we should\nsee things improving from now on.\nGiven the fact that with no real depletion in incomes, it is now a pure play, her capability to pay.\nIf she has, she will give money to everybody, if not at best she'll sequence for her to get a fresh\nloan from anywhere.\nShalabh Saxena: The pain -- yes. So temporarily, somebody would -- some enterprise will have to bear that will\nhave to take it or will have to bear the pain. But eventually, I think it will stabilize. So my sense\nis that you will see and not just us, for everybody. We will see a lot of recoveries, a lot of money\nfrom recoveries flowing in, from GNPA pools and the write-off pools.\nKunal Shah: Okay. And when you look at it, one of the player was indicating that once we into the lesser\nleveraged customers or maybe just like three lenders, there could be some pressure on field as\nwell, okay? Because currently, larger part of the yield is also maybe driven by the customers\nwho have like more than four lender relationships. So do you think that could have a pressure\nover 2, 3 quarters in terms of yield structurally coming down for the industry?\nAshish Damani: Kunal, I think these customers are not that sensitive to the interest rates as such. And even when\nwe are speaking about the differential, the industry operates today in a very tight range of, let's\nsay, 22% to 24%, 25% at best. So the yield or the interest rate, I'm not very sure it will be a\ndriving thing for the customers to take that decision.\nYes, but loan amounts or for that matter, the ease of getting a loan or the timing, those definitely\nare some of the aspects which – or let's say, sometimes the customer is in the fag end of their\nloan with somebody. Probably they will be looking forward to repay that of first because they\ncan get a fresh loan from that entity. Those will be the driving points for such customers rather\nthan the interest rates.\nHaving said that, I think most of the institutions, including Spandana have a staggered interest\nrates where you would want to retain your good customers and thus you pass on the benefits on\nthe interest rate to customers in subsequent cycle. That is taken care of.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nModerator: The next question comes from Viral Shah from IIFL Securities.\nViral Shah: Shalabh, just wanted to basically again touch base on the question. But we are looking at\nSpandana plus 4 or more lender association. I understand, of course, there's a denominator\nimpact. But even if I adjust and look at it on an absolute basis, there is just INR40 crores quarter-\non-quarter decline, which is like 3%. And this is despite having a INR660 crores plus of write-\noff, right? So basically, does it mean that at an industry level, even the first guardrail is not being\nadhered to?\nShalabh Saxena: I'm not sure how -- you need a lot of data to come to that conclusion, Viral. So I'm not exactly -\n- maybe we'll take it offline in terms of understanding how you go to that number, but...\nViral Shah: Basically, what I've look at Shalabh is, see you had some INR10,000-odd crores AUM, right, as\nof October or September, right? Of course, that is the September number on the denominator\nside. But when I look at September AUM, and apply the 13.8% and then what is your AUM,\nwhich is INR8,900 crores something in this quarter and I applied the 15.8%.\nThe absolute decline is INR40 crores. This is after you having written off INR660 crores on the\nportfolio, right. That's how your AUM is at the end of this quarter. And when I'm saying is why\nis the industry not adhering to them, basically, who is lending to the customer, which by the first\nguardrail no one can lend to?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So look, I will answer -- I mean, I'll answer the second part, Ashish, in the meantime will\nanswer the first.\nAshish Damani: So one, this is not driven by AUM, these are like a number of borrowers. So it is not necessarily\njust the AUM part. It is also the count part.\nViral Shah: So then if that is the case, then basically people are lending even more to those borrowers. Does\nthat mean that?\nShalabh Saxena: So let me answer the second, which is the question that you are asking. Look, there is no choice\nof people who signed up this code of conduct with the association or the SRO. There is no option\nfor them not to follow. So it's a signed up document and it's a signed up agreement. And I do not\nhave as a company an option to follow or not follow. There could have been some and this\nincludes the banks, the universal banks, the SFBs, everybody, it's not just the NBFC or the\nNBFC-MFI. That's number one.\nNumber two, yes, there could be plus or minus in terms of instead of July, somebody would have\nimplemented it in August or September because of tech developments. It requires a lot of tech\ndevelopments and a lot of testing before you are ready. So I would -- Viral, I would say that give\nor take 15 days 10 days here and there, I would really be surprised if there's somebody who is\nnot following it. And at least we until now have not come up with a situation. There could be\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\ntechnical misses in an IT, in some company here and there, but not following brazenly -- I'm not\n-- I don't think so. Let's just say that.\nViral Shah: So Shalabh, you are saying it came from July, right? I'm looking at the number versus October.\nSo by October also, if no one is able to implement, then are we actually jumping the gun.\nShalabh Saxena: No, Viral, according to me, when you see the real impact in at least one to two quarters, you\nshould see it. You should just wait for about -- it operates with a lag, slightly with a lag. That's\nreason why I kind of dealt at length with why are the customers, what has happened that the\ncustomers are returning back to the center meetings? Why are the customers engaging with us?\nI do believe that everybody has kind of implemented it and maybe a clearer picture for all of us\nto see. And for all of you to see would probably be end of this quarter, but I have at least\npersonally not come across an instance where this has not been followed.\nViral Shah: Shalabh, again, on that point, can you give us like who are the -- like what number of MFIs,\nbanks, SFBs have been signatory to this MFIN guardrail 1 and how much AUM does that\nrepresent at an industry level?\nShalabh Saxena: So we can take it offline, Viral. I mean, obviously, I don't have the number handy -- but\npractically, it would cover minus the SHGs, I think it should cover everyone.\nViral Shah: Okay. Then the second -- next question relating -- again, on the data point. But more I would\nsay on this theme, is are we basically -- and when I say we, not specifically Spandana, so don't\ntake it in that sense. But as an industry, jumping the gun and saying that the worst is behind and\nDecember is showing improvement, because, see, by definition, X bucket collection efficiency\nhas to improve, right? After 9 months of pain, if you remove the delinquent customers, by\ndefinition, it has to improve.\nShalabh Saxena: Agreed. First of all, worst is behind is not a statement I have used ever. In this call or I won't and\nin fact -- no, no, fair enough. Fair enough. I'm sure somebody would have used it. I have been\nvery cautious in what I said. What I said and even our presentation says that. It says green shoots\nand it says early indications. Early indications when they solidify into a trend, which you have\nto give at least 3 to 4 months to thump your chest and say that it's going the way that we would\nhave liked to.\nAll we qualified was that December was decent, almost a 3.4, 2.4 uptick from the previous\nmonth. We have to wait for the trends to really be very sure of when when we kind of see the\nthings, where we can say that we are confident now we are the worst is past. So my guess is we\nhave to be slightly cautious on this. It is not a trend as yet. Another 2 months will really give\nyou a fair picture of, yes, the so-called worst is behind us. And now what you are left is this\nbucket, which you have to deal with, then you have to address those markets. But at least you\nget rid of your leaking bucket problem, which is currently we are facing.\nViral Shah: Fair enough, Shalabh. And just on your point, If the compliance, say, after, say, 6 months of the\nGuardrail 1 is what it is. How are we sure, say, we won't have this similar kind of problem, say,\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\na year down the line, of course, because everyone has a shorter memory in terms of when the\nthings normalize. How does one get that confidence, he won't be the similar situation, say, 1\nyear or 2 years down the line?\nShalabh Saxena: Look, so to each company its own. As far as we are concerned, we've obviously learnt our\nlessons in terms of what position to take, which geographies to expand and most importantly, it\nhas to do the biggest takeaway in this whole issue for the last 3 quarters has been how we deal\nwith our employees, how do we deal with their well-being, their careers, their recognition, their\nrewards and so on and so forth. That's number one. The second bucket is the customer bucket.\nObviously, these guardrails take care, at least structurally, the customer from a pureplay lending\npoint of view. Once you are assured of that bucket, then what is left is your employees and how\nyou kind of bring your attrition levels down to about 2%, 2.5% per month.\nThat's a more manageable attrition because that is the only gap that need -- that's a new thing\nwhich has come up in the last 3 quarters, which is good from an enterprise point of view and\nfrom a company's point of view because that is what you have to address. And once that is taken\ncare of and the structural initiatives take care of the customer behavior, I think we should be\ngood to go.\nViral Shah: Fair enough. And Shalabh, if I may, just one last question.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, yes, please.\nViral Shah: So basically, from -- of course, the 3 lender cap has been deferred to April. But when I then look\nat the overlap, the other 2 guardrails so as to say they have gone into implementation, right? And\nwhen I look at the overlap of MFI borrowers and them having non- MFI loans, so that nearly\nrepresents in aggregate to INR1.1 lakh crores, whatever you want to take it, the updated number,\nand that represents nearly 20%, 25% of the total MFI industry, right?\nSo if we are seeing this kind of pain for a customer who has, say, more than 3 or 4 loans, which\nare MFI loans, what about the customers who are so overleveraged ? And does it mean that say\ncustomers who just have three or more than three loans, your LGDs are at least in this cycle and\nimmediately in next 2, 3 quarters, the LGDs are going to be north of I would say, 90%.\nShalabh Saxena: Viral, so guardrail is a direction, which has been given. You need not stop at that. You can go a\nstep forward and restrict the borrowing by the criteria that you wish. In the examples that you\nquoted, the customers borrow from a lot of these fintechs, etcetera. So it is entirely upon the\nenterprise to kind of take a call in terms of any unsecured that you want to do. You will not do,\nwhether it is from an NBFC-MFI or whether it is outside.\nSo that is what each enterprise will be doing, like we have done. And we'll continue to do because\nfurther what has been pronounced is a bare minimum. And anything beyond that, it is the\nprudence and the risk taking appetite of the company, which will come into play. At this point\nin time, and I go back to the first question which was asked, at this point in time, it is better to\nerr on caution and probably continue this for at least 4 to 6 quarters before we really are confident\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nthat the absorption capacity of the household and I'm moving away from the customer to the\nhousehold is enough to kind of fulfill the liabilities, all the liability, borrowing liabilities that\nhave been taken. And likewise, the other way also, I presume for all the companies which are\nkind of lending, which are non-MFI, when they are lending to the household, they would be\nlooking at the household liability as well.\nSo the right thing to do is to look at the overall household liability, which all of us are doing,\nplus and then obviously, you can go down to whatever you want to whether you want to take the\nmobile phone loan that she would have taken, her husband would have taken as a liability and\nthen calculate the FOIR, etcetera, all of those things are a matter of the companies and the\nenterprises credit policy.\nModerator: Next question is from the line of Rajeev Jindal from Hero FinCorp.\nRajeev Jindal: So my question is -- all those were limiting my questions, although there has been discussion on\nthese numbers only till now. So my point or my question is that, so what are the recovery rates\nin the softer bucket, bucket 1 and bucket 2. And is there any improvement in the recovery rates\nin the last 3 months, if it is deteriorating? So what it was in September? And what are the\nnumbers as of now? So that is my question number one. I have another question.\nSo on the thing Spandana and the multiple lenders, the Spandana plus 1 and Spandana plus 2.\nSo like you have taken the numbers from the bureau scrub, so do you have any performance\nanalysis how these borrowers are performing with Spandana and with the other peer lenders?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, the second one, I'll answer, the first one, Ashish will answer. Do we have the number? Yes,\nwe have. But we don't really – there is a specific purpose, we don't really have the number handy.\nSeparately, we can connect and assess.\nRajeev Jindal: Okay. Okay.\nShalabh Saxena: First one was bucket 1 and bucket 2.\nAshish Damani: I mean, we have already given the current bucket efficiencies, Rajeev, we've talked about that\n97.84%, which is nothing but from the current bucket, the remaining is the flow. And the Stage\n2 normally hovers around -- what we have seen is prior to June was around, let's say, 45% to\n50% is now stacking at around 40%.\nRajeev Jindal: Okay. So this is constant for last, say, 3, 4 months, maybe for the last 6 months?\nAshish Damani: Yes. It is moving -- it will move maybe, 100 basis points plus or minus at best.\nShalabh Saxena: So Rajeev, this whole when you operate in these volumes, the most important thing is to stop\nyour leaking bucket. You have stop your X flows because once it flows, then it's only a question\nof what percentage, so which obviously is not the best situation to be in because you are\ncollecting also your loan officers job is not to chase the customer through the month. So that is\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 23, 2025\nwhat it is. So it's always good to kind of be focused on the lead indicator, which is the X bucket\nand the other things are a matter of obviously the regular activity.\nModerator: Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question for the day. I would now like to hand the\nconference over to the management for the closing comments.\nShalabh Saxena: So thank you, all of you to -- for having attended this and showing interest in our organization.\nThe company and the industry is obviously going through a slightly different phase, not the\nregular BAU. But given the trends that we have seen, we really hope that -- this works to\neverybody's advantage and most importantly, the customer's advantage because we deal with the\nsegment, which is the so-called bottom of pyramid. And it's very important that the household\nthere has a regular supply of formal credit at very reasonable rates to ensure that the income-\ngenerating loan that they take is put to good use. So that's the endeavor that we are in and all of\nus are in. So thank you for the interest, and thank you very much.\nModerator: Thank you. On behalf of Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited, that concludes this conference.\nThank you all for joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines.\n"

Thank you, and over to you, sir.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you very much. Good evening to all of you. Thank you for taking time out to attend our\nearnings call. This is the fifth quarter of the new management in Spandana and I am satisfied to\nstate that we've come a long way from a year back when in July 2022, we had presented our\nVision 2025. Since then, we've received a lot of valuable feedback, suggestions and advice from\nall the stakeholders for which we are very grateful. Please have the suggestions and advice\nflowing our way, we need them.\nAs you are aware, we had identified five priorities for us as a management team when we\npresented Vision’25. We have made significant progress on each of the five priorities, and I\nwould start by providing an update on those. Number one and most important-\nPeople, reinforcing senior and middle management team.: As announced in our last earnings\ncall, we now have all the 13 key positions filled and all the minus 1 levels are also adequately\nstaffed. Thus, our senior leadership hiring agenda now stands complete with a strong\nmanagement team in place. Our focus now is on setting-up employee centric people practices\nwith the aim to make Spandana a preferred employer. We have started work on this already. And\nin the next two quarters to three quarters, we intend to make progress on this key agenda item.\nThe second point was strengthen governance risk and control with added focus on refining\nprocesses. A lot of our efforts in the previous year were dedicated in refining and further\nstrengthening governance, risk and control. We have been calibrating our exposure norms,\ntweaking policies where necessary to add strength to our governance framework. Streamlining\nprocesses was also a major focus area during the last five quarters. This is a continuous process,\nand we will keep working on it consistently.\nNumber three, focus on customer acquisition-led business growth, while ensuring retention of\ngood existing customers. We continue to drive growth through member acquisition. We had\nadded 8.8 lakh new borrowers during FY '23, which is last year. In the current quarter as well,\nwe've added 2.6 lakh new borrowers. As we expand the new geographies, our new borrower\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nadditions will continue to trend higher. By end of the year, we intend acquiring more than 1\nmillion new customers, thus taking our customer base upwards of 3 million or thereabouts.\nPoint number four, technology scale up to deliver an end-to-end paperless process for customers.\nWe are continuously scouting for and investing in technology to make our systems robust and\nprocess simple for our employees and customers. Our focus has been an agile LOS and LMS\nand most importantly, a safe and secure back end. We believe that technology will drive the next\nwave of growth.\nPoint number five, customer-focused initiatives with emphasis on products and service. We had\nenvisaged a non-micro finance loan book of over INR2,000 crores by FY '25 and are taking\nconcrete steps in that direction. We have introduced loan against property in the new geography\nof Rajasthan. We will soon be launching the Nano enterprise loans in select markets. We look\nforward to scaling up these product offerings in multiple markets in the coming quarters. This is\napart from the INR15,000 crores of book in micro finance, which we have planned end of FY\n'25.\nApart from the five priorities, we are well possessed of the fact that there is a large scope for\nbuilding efficiencies in our distribution network. We are taking a number of steps to ensure right\nutilization of resources. We anticipate a 15% to 20% improvement in efficiencies in the current\ndistribution metrics that we operate and over the next two quarters to three quarters, we will see\nthe benefits play out. Our focus on growing in the seven states, which were Rajasthan, UP, Bihar,\nHaryana, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Gujarat where we have a very low market share\ncontinues to gain ground.\nOver the past two quarters, we opened a net 188 branches, most of which are in these focus\nstates. We want Spandana to have a meaningful share of microfinance portfolio in these states.\nA large portion of our loan book and borrower addition growth is expected to come out of these\nseven states.\nAs is there in the presentation, about 26% of new borrowers added during the quarter were from\nthese seven focus states. While some of our initiatives result in immediate impact during the\nquarter, many others will take a quarter or two to translate into tangible results. But I can say\nthis with reasonable surety that we are on the right track.\nHaving said that, let me present the results of Q1 FY '24. The results and the investor presentation\nhave already uploaded on the NSE, BSE websites. I'm sure you would have gone through, but\nI'll quickly go through the results.\nDisbursements, as you are aware, Q1 is usually a seasonally low quarter for the microfinance\nindustry. We disbursed INR1,664 crores during the quarter, up 26% Y-o-Y. On AUM, we ended\nthe quarter at an AUM of INR8,848 crores, an all-time high for Spandana. This was 60% growth\nY-o-Y and a growth of 4% over the previous quarter.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nCustomer acquisition. One of the strong pillars of our Vision 2025 is customer acquisition-led\ngrowth strategy. During the quarter, we added close to 2.6 lakh new borrowers, which is 144%\nhigher than the same quarter previous year.\nOn the borrowing side, you are aware this is the key component of any NBFC and its\nfunctioning. The quarter saw a total borrowing of INR1,540 crores, up INR894 crores from last\nyear Q1. Our marginal cost of borrowings was slightly lower at 12.3% as against 12.6% in Q4\nFY 23. Weighted average cost of borrowing was largely stable at 12.5%, up by 9 bps\noverQ4FY23. We continue to strengthen relationships with our borrowers while continuously\nhaving dialogue with other lender partners.\nOn the portfolio quality: Our portfolio quality continues to improve over the quarters. The\nstandard, which is the current book is at 97.1%, an improvement from 96.6% over the previous\nquarter and a marked improvement from 68.4% in Q4 of FY '22. The 1-90 bucket is 1.36% now,\nwhich was 1.54% in Q4 of FY '23. Of the 1-90 book 40%, that is 0.55% is in 1-30 bucket.\nThe GNPA end of Q1 FY '24 now stands at 1.63% and the NNPA is 0.49% on the back of\nimproved quality and higher provisioning. Of the GNPA pool, about 42% is contributed by pre-\nApril '21 book, which itself is 1.2% of the loan book now.\nOn the collection efficiency front, net collection efficiency for the period was 98.1% as against\n97.6% in Q4. We continue to see improvements in net collection efficiency, which is a very\nhealthy sign. Gross collection efficiency for the quarter was 101.5%. Our focus at the distribution\nlevel is net, because that is the timely repayment and that is what we are driving as a team.\nFinancials for Q4. We continue to maintain a provision coverage of 70.1% on the consolidated\nbook in the current quarter, and NNPA has reduced to 0.49% and GNPA improved to 1.63%.\nThe number for the previous quarter were 2.07% and 0.64%. Our yield on the portfolio has\nimproved to 24% from normalized yield of 22.8% in quarter 4 and 16.4% in Q1 of FY '23.\nNIM is 14.2%. That is up 38 basis points over normalized NIM of last quarter and 434 bps over\nquarter 1 of FY ‘23. Total income for the quarter increased 104% to INR527 crores versus\nINR259 crores in Q1 of FY ‘23. Net interest income was up 102% to INR328 crores for the\nquarter was INR162 crores in quarter 1 FY ‘23.\nPPOP for the quarter was INR189 crores, up to 273% over INR51 crores reported for the same\nquarter previous year. PBT for the quarter was INR161 crores, PAT INR119 crores, which is an\nincrease of 13% sequentially over the past quarter. We had reported a loss of INR220 crores\nduring the same quarter of previous year, owing to a write-off of the INR702 crores that we have\ndone in Q1, as all of you are aware.\nSo to summarize, we have the building blocks in place and now are completely focused on\nexecution and delivery of our Vision 2025 targets. This year is all about efficiencies, productivity\nand refining processes. Our plans for having 1,500 operational branches by end of FY '25 is on\ntrack.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nAnd over the past six months, we've opened, as I said earlier, 188 branches. We continue to build\nthe distribution where we feel there are opportunities obviously, quality of the specific\ngeography drives our decision making. We continue to experience strong economic tailwinds in\nour markets, driving demand for micro loans. We continue to be cautiously optimistic about the\ngrowth potential of the microfinance industry in India.\nI thank all the stakeholders of Spandana, the Board, our lenders and our colleagues in Spandana,\nwho pulled in their energies during the year. A special note of thanks to all the branch staff, our\nloan offices, branch managers and the entire field staff who work hard day in and day out to\ndeliver the results that collectively all of us have envisaged.\nThank you very much to all of you on the call. You have been a constant source of\nencouragement by giving us positive advice feedback and, of course, support during the year.\nWe look forward to receiving similar encouragement in the future.\nWe have the entire management team with us and are ready to take questions from you. Thank\nyou very much.\nModerator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We take the first\nquestion from the line of Shreepal Doshi from Equirus. Please go ahead.\nShreepal Doshi: Sir, congrats on a good set of numbers. I had the first question on the collection efficiency. So\nwe see that collection efficiency for MFI lenders are ranging between 98% to 99%. So is it fair\nto assume that this is the new normal for the sector post COVID now? And therefore, the credit\ncost would also broadly be increasing to say 1% to 2%?\nShalabh Saxena: See, for the -- so there are two questions that you asked in that one question. The first is net\ncollection efficiency is a timely repayment and sometimes the payment comes with a lag. The\npayment comes with a lag for various reasons. It is sometimes a company-driven thing also, the\nemployee might be on leave, etc. So there are various layers in this whole thing. The credit cost\nif you have to look at, you have to look at it in the context of whether you're receiving the\npayment or not and that is where you should look at gross collection efficiency.\nOn the timely repayment, which is the fundamental discipline of micro finance, the net collection\nefficiency is what we are driving amongst our teams. To answer your question, Shreepal, 99%\nis what we are targeting in the short term. Is it a new norm, maybe at this point in time, -- while\nwe built in all our financial credit cost of 2%, we anticipate the number to be lower, a 1%-1.25%.\nAny company and not just us.any good company if it runs its model well; it should not deliver a\ncredit loss of1.5% or maybe 1.6%, that's it. So that's our take on this whole thing. We obviously\nhave done some conservative estimates on the credit loss valuations, and that's where we are.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it, sir. Thank you. The second question was you highlighted about tech initiatives. So what\nis the capex or expense that we are likely to incurred over the next one year for these initiatives?\nAnd then on the opex, even during quarter, the employee cost was significantly higher on a\nsequential basis. So what explains that?\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nShalabh Saxena: Employee cost.\nAshish Damani: Hi Shreepal, this is Ashish, this side. The employee costs are higher because we had gone\nthrough our annual increment cycle, and there is also a headcount increase, which has happened\nbetween last quarter, around March and then again in this quarter as well for the branches that\nwe have rolled out. So those are the two parameters which have kind of added to the cost. But\nas we go along, the employee cost change on a sequential quarter basis should normalize because\nthis was more of an annual increment exercise, Thus, you are seeing a jump between previous\nquarter and this quarter.\nShalabh Saxena: On the second question, which is this year, our IT cost is about INR75 crores of split into a capex\nof about INR20 crores and the balance is opex. We have budgeted this adequately until FY '25,\nand we will do another three years excise next year when we'll kind of bake the future years as\nwell into this.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it, sir. Sir, just last question. With respect to the income revaluation that we have to do as\nper the RBI norms. So if there is any household which has got household income of more than\nINR3 lakh. Firstly, what is the process that we have deployed for evaluating the household\nincome, and secondly if there is any household income who is making more than INR3 lakh then\ndo we have a product for that customer?\nShalabh Saxena: At this point in time, Shreepal, and in our various commentaries, we've been stressing the fact\nthat we are very basic bread-and-butter people. We don't want to deviate and hence, the right\nanswer to this question is that we will put them under the non-PSL, non-qualifying assets and\nbook them. But as of now, we are not approaching them. I mean, if it doesn't fall then the lady\nis out. We don't source that case because as I said, last year and this year, we are just sticking to\nthe fundamentals of business. And given the fact that we are doing the JLG model of micro\nfinance, that is what we are foreseeing.\nModerator: Thank you. We take the next question from the line of Manuj Oberoi from YES Securities.\nPlease go ahead.\nRajiv Mehta: Yes. Hi, sir, this is Rajiv. Congratulations on very strong set of numbers. My first question is on\ngrowth. So sir, were there any specific operational changes still implemented in this first quarter\nbecause when I look at disbursement, there seem to be lower even adjusted for seasonality. So\nthat is one.\nAnd another related question is, is there any change in duration of the portfolio over the last two\nquarters because I see portfolio run off in this quarter being slightly slower than usual?\nShalabh Saxena: So the second part of your question I understood. Can you just repeat the first part? Sorry, I\ndidn't understand.\nRajiv Mehta: Yes. So were there any specific operational changes on the ground, which also led to a lower\ndisbursement in this quarter, besides your own seasonality?\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nShalabh Saxena: So Manoj. we have a defined goal in mind. Rajiv.\nRajiv Mehta: Yes, Rajiv, this side, yes.\nShalabh Saxena: So Rajiv, we have a defined goal in mind on FY '24 and FY '25. As you've seen in the\npresentation, we are already at INR8,848 crores. We are very close to about the INR9,000 mark\njust about INR150 crores. We are in no hurry to report. Microfinance is all about pacing your\ninnings. Microfinance is not a T20.\nMicrofinance is a test match. And the test match has to last a full five days, don't have to end the\ntest in three days or four days. We know exactly what we are doing just because there is an\nopportunity, where you cannot or should not change or alter your plan. We are cognizant that --\nand I will repeat this Microfinance is a risk management business. It is not an asset business.\nIt is important that the teams on the ground are culturally aligned to the sense of responsibility\nthat you do not as an institution deviate on the quality that you're sourcing. Hence, I heard your\nquestion or rather your observation, my view is that we know exactly where we have to end and\nwe've given the last call also, there was a point on this. We are in no hurry to end the match in\nthree days.\nOur goal defined this year and next year, which is INR15,000 crores in FY '25 is fixed. It could\nbe a few INR100 crores here and there. In all likelihood, it will be over. But very difficult to\nkind of stick our neck out and say instead of 15, we'll do 17. There is no need. So past is enough\nhistory that if you are not cautious, you end up burning your fingers, hands and everything. So\nthat is very clear. We'll pace our innings to ensure that the quality is delivered and that is what\nwe are doing.\nSo we had said in the last call that we as an institution has to very, very clearly deliver quality\napart from the top line as well. And if you would have followed our numbers over the past four\nquarters that we've been coming here. That's a testimony of the fact. So cautious lending is the\nright approach in my view. Quarter 1 either way, this is what was the plan and we are just about\nthere.\nRajiv Mehta: Okay. Got that. And now the question is on NIM outlook because -- so what is the space for the\nportfolio yield are moving up because it has moved pretty significantly in the last two quarters.\nAnd secondly, the other variable for NIM will be the cost of funds and I see marginal cost of\nfunds coming down and we also raising sizeable coming up money at lower cost. So basis the\nexpected movement in cost of funds over the next few quarters and maybe more residual re-\npricing of portfolio, where do you think NIMs can go to?\nAshish Damani: Hi Rajiv. Good evening. Yes, there is a quarter or two more for our NIM's to see at least around\nthe same number or small expansion as well, primarily on account of yield probably inching-up\na little bit more given that we've been lending at 25%, there is a little headroom there. We are\npresently at 24% yield and you would never hit the 25%, but there is still a little bit of headroom\nthere. So a quarter or two, you may continue to see some inching up.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nOn the cost of fund side, I think we've seen a drop last quarter. We hope to see a little more drop\ngiven that as an institution, we have been having a consistent performance for the last five\nquarters now. I think there is a scope of improvement in terms of how or what kind of pricing\nthat we are borrowing at. So yes, we are positively inclined to maintain the NIMs at the current\nlevels.\nRajiv Mehta: Sure. Ashish, can I just ask one more question before I move back?\nAshish Damani: Sure. Go ahead.\nRajiv Mehta: It is on the provisioning line. So there's a INR26 crores provision made against receivables from\nassignment portfolio. It can’t be against that direct assignment portfolio, right? So what is it\npertaining to?\nAshish Damani: So this is a direct assignment only. So there were certain customers where the collections did\nnot go through. And during the period (IT disruption), earlier period, when we did not have the\nIT or whatever information we kind of have paid in advance to the banks. We are still trying to\ncollect it from the customers. As a prudence, we have kind of provided against that portfolio just\nto have a clean set of books.\nRajiv Mehta: Yes. So any more hit likely, yes, or we are done with this?\nAshish Damani: We still have about INR24 crores of portfolio, which is there on balance sheet, which we will\nhave to see and calibrate as we go along.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sagar Tanna from Alchemy Ventures. Please\ngo ahead.\nSagar Tanna: Hi, sir. If I heard you correctly, you expect credit cost to be 1.5%-1.6% for the year, is that\ncorrect?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes.\nSagar Tanna: But what is the outlook because we still keep getting mix commentaries with respect to rural\nrecovery, etc, what is your outlook in terms of how the economy is shaping up on that side of\nthe country?\nShalabh Saxena: So look, the credit demand is very strong, and we have seen a lot of turnaround from a quality\npoint of view. So that is the heartening fact in this whole micro finance story. So micro finance\nover a period of time has seen lots of ups and downs. And post-COVID, a year now a year, 1.5\nyears, that it has seen strong tailwinds, both from the economy point of view and the heavy\ninvestment that the government is doing infrastructurally in the Bharat of India.\nSo from a quality point of view, I think if you run the operations well, the number that I said\nshould hold that unless there are some unforeseen, unknown issues, which might not kind of\nfavour the industry. As far as the industry is concerned, concentration risk is very, very\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nimportant. And as an enterprise, we are ensuring that we walk the steps to ensure the\nconcentrations are moderated across the states where you see the elevated levels on the market\nshare and the contribution that a specific state does give to us.\nSo that is what we are working at, and until FY '25, right now, we have a couple of states that\n14%- 15% contribution. We have a clear plan to get them down to 11%-12%. So in our estimate,\ncombination of concentration, plus good execution of the model. Relying on JLG to ensure that\nthere's a safety net are the critical components of this model. And I can say this is a reasonable\nsurety that if all of these are done well, there’s a good chance that as an enterprise, we will stand\nto gain on this.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jignesh Shial from InCred Capital. Please go\nahead.\nJignesh Shial: I have two questions. One, has there been any write-off during the quarter? And any recoveries\nfrom the previous written-off quarter, any number on that you have it?\nAshish Damani: Yes. So write-off for the quarter is driven by the policy that we have taken up last quarter, which\nis any loans, which move into 455-plus days, will be moved to technical write-offs. The number\nwas INR21 crores. The impact of this was around INR5.8 crores in the P&L. In terms of\nrecovery, the total recovery that we had was INR23 crores across the write-off.\nShalabh Saxena: So of the INR700 crores and other write-offs that we have done, we've collected all put together\nabout INR90 crores is the specific question that you asked from the time we started this journey.\nJignesh Shial: Understood. That's very helpful. And secondly, you've been doing pretty good on the MFI side.\nAnd as you rightly pointed out earlier that more-and-more focus would be on incremental\nbranches and states I asked the same question last time as well. But if you can brief out a little\nbit more in detail about other than MFI businesses, how we are shaping up and how we are\nseeing that things are opening over next two years? But at least how are the beginning has been\nthere, if you can give some idea on it that could be really helpful other than your MFI business.\nShalabh Saxena: So Jignesh, we will -- it's early for us to -- I mean, we started booking loans on the LAP side.\nWe will launch the Nano enterprise, which is the small ticket loans to retailers. A 60,000 ticket\nsize is the number that we will start with it is a non-JLG business. That should start in this\nquarter. These two businesses this year is testing the waters and seeing how it goes. These are\npretty fast moving. There is an opportunity, a lot of opportunity, and we'll continue to focus on\nthe lower ticket sizes.\nI mean, we are not intending to give loans of INR20 lakhs, INR25 lakhs on the LAP, for example.\nSweet spot is INR5 lakh to INR7 lakhs. And on the Nano enterprise, I said our loans will be at\nINR60,000 to INR1 lakh. So there is tremendous demand for these loans because this is the\nmissing segment. The banks don't go after them and their business mostly survive on borrowings\nfrom friends and relatives.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nOnce again being unsecured in nature, at least the Nano enterprise, we have to be cautious and\nthat is what we will. On the LAP side, it obviously is a secured business. And that we are\nfocusing on productivity. There's a slightly longish gestation period business. Its not a MFI\nbusiness, which turns around very fast. But it holds tremendous promise for the profile of\ncustomers and the segments that we have identified. And maybe next quarter, when we come,\nwe will have more colour on this because we'll have some volumes backing whatever we speak\nright now it is insignificant volume to kind of give any commentary on.\nJignesh Shial: Understood. But just one thing that this will be all focused on the new customer base altogether,\nright? Not to the existing ones\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So absolutely. And what we have done is that we have opened a separate set of branches\nwe are not cutting corners by putting them into MFI branches because ultimately, it is the same\ninstitution. But we are very clear. We are not making the model fungible, we are not cutting\ncorners. The places where to open a branch is a factor of the geography and the potential and\nhas nothing to do with whether Spandana is around or not.\nI mean the Spandana MFI is around or not. It is a completely new set from a Chief Business\nOfficer down to the Loan Officer. It is a complete separate team it works differently. It works\nand the hirings have been done from the industry so that they have a fair colour of how this\nplayed out. It's a new business for us, but it holds a lot of promise. The new business that we\nhave launched in the state of Rajasthan, I don’t know, you are aware or not, but when we took\nover this book, this is not a new business for Spandana because this was being done in Andhra\nand Telangana. We had a book of about INR117 crores when I had taken over.\nAnd now it is around INR51 crores, INR52 crores. So it has run down because we were looking\nfor a good LMS and LOS. We wanted to do business properly and just because the opportunity\nwas goodwe really did not hurry into launching this business. we were servicing our existing\nbook. We stopped all disbursements for a year. That is why the book run down from INR117\ncrores to INR51 crores.\nNow we have started in a different state, which is Rajasthan, which is supposedly a fertile\ngeography for this kind of a setup because the customers are evolved there. And we see a lot of\navailable demand and untapped demand in this market in this segment, and that is what we will\ncontinue to progress on.\nJignesh Shial: Understood. And is it fair to assume that the yield on this new segment would be lower than\nyour typical MFI portfolio, but the tenure would be longer one. So the EMI will become more\nstickier?\nShalabh Saxena: That's correct. Yes, that's correct. Absolutely.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Renish from ICICI Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nRenish: Yes. Hi, Shalabh and Ashish, congrats for good set of numbers. Sir, just two questions from my\nside. One, you've been on the qualitative side since we have started this journey of weekly\ncollection model so of the total MFI branches which are on the weekly collection, is there any\nsplit, let's say, how much of this would be earlier into monthly model?\nShalabh Saxena: No. So the new branches, Renish, that we are opening irrespective of the states will be weekly.\nThat is number one. Number two, for a customer who you contracted at a monthly, it would be\nunfair for us to work weekly path because it might not happen. So we have clearly laid out plan\nin terms of how do you convert or rather phase. How do you phase out the current monthly\nmodel across the branches because we have three sets of branches. Branches, which are low on\nAUM, medium AUM and very big branches.\nThe very big branches are at some 285 or 286 numbers, our of the 1,100, 1,200. Those branches,\nwe will not touch this year. There's other things that we are doing, but they will remain monthly.\nThe other branches, we have a phase-wise plan on how do you kind of recalibrate them to convert\nthem into a weekly. Because by definition, about 60%, 70% in a steady state business will go to\nour existing customer.\nAnd if you keep on booking a monthly loan, this will never really work. So you’ll never be able\nto depart from the monthly. So we are believers in the weekly model, just as we are strong\nbelievers in the JLG. So there are clearly articulated plan internally that we have on how are we\ngoing to move the existing set of monthly branches into weekly.\nRenish Bhuva: Okay. And like, say, while implementing this, have you witnessed any, let's say, pushback from\nthe client or the staff where we might see some pushback in implementing weekly model?\nShalabh Saxena: Weekly model. So what are we attempting to do, Renish. We are attempting to do all the three\nthings, which is a customer acquisition, a collection and a disbursement. All the three things,\nevery single day of the 20 working days that you have, 20, 21. The new set of branches that we\nhave opened is a fresh staff, and that is a easier one. I mean, most of our team members do realize\nand any event such as a COVID or maybe a demonetization which happened many years back.\nIn case whenever there are challenges in the environment, weekly customers isn the weekly\nmodel comes out of a crisis much quicker than the others because the liability at least at the EMI\nlevel is very nominal of INR600, INR650 instead of the INR2,400, INR2,500.\nNow the point is that -- so the answer to your question is, we've got very good support from our\npeople. The plan was made, taking them very much on board in terms of how they are doing.\nPlus what happens is that when it comes to a Monday to Friday, Monday to Friday rigour--\nRenish. What happens is the staff gets a Saturday, Sunday, which is much more relaxed rather\nthan the earlier regimented approach of a Saturday, Sunday because we had a different collection\nmodel of 1, to 10. So the long answer to your question, we have got very good support because\nwe took them into confidence before walking this path. And now obviously, we are progressing\non that.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nRenish Bhuva: Got it. And sir, secondly, on the, let's say, growth side. So we have seen most of the companies\nreporting better numbers in Q1 despite being seasonally weak quarter. And if I recall our\nguidance for ‘24, ‘25, we had laid down a year back. I think since then the industry or is the\nbusiness cycle has changed dramatically. So would you like to give, let's say, a revised guidance\nor any commentary on the guidance, which you have put down on your back?\nShalabh Saxena: So if you look at our numbers, we ended the last year at INR8,511 crores. We are at INR8,848\ncrores now. If all goes as per plan, we will hit the INR10,000 crores number in either the last\nmonth of this quarter or the first month of the next quarter. So we should end the year at about\nto INR11,750 crores to INR12,000 crores, roughly, that is the number that we are looking at,\nwhich works out to in my mind, more decent Y-o-Y growth for FY.\nThis growth is coming from the new areas. So that is very, very critical. We are opening those\nnew geographies, new branches, which will kind of deliver the numbers that we are talking to.\nEarlier also, we've stated this position that we are not great fans of big ticket sizes. We'll continue\nto deliver loans in small packets. -- and that is, what we are planning to do. That is why the\nnumbers on the customer acquisition side you would have seen.\nMaybe two quarters from now, we will evaluate the movement on the ticket sizes. I understand\nthere's inflationary 6% increase, that I ideally one should be doing on a ticket size to stay at par.\nBut, at this point in time, we are not facing any resistance either from the customer or our\nemployees. And we are happy that way. We are clear that, more number of customers is the way\nto go, and not really…\nAshish Damani: In fact, Renish I'll just add a point about what Shalabh was trying to allude to. If you look at our\nticket sizes, this quarter, the weekly is coming into play now, given that, we have weekly\nbusiness at 35,000 in the first ticket size instead of 42000, which we do in a monthly setup. And\nthat has impacted our average ticket sizes. It is marginally lower compared to last quarter. It is\naround 41,000 compared to 42,000 plus last quarter.\nShalabh Saxena: So Renish, if you see within our company, we are following two ticket sizes. But then in our\nticket -- in a cycle one, monthly, our ticket size is 40,000 in a weekly model, whichever the 188\nbranches that we have opened, the ticket size is 35,000, and that's the start point. So we are\nconvinced that, you don't loose a customer for INR3,000, INR5,000. There are other things,\nwhich come into play, which is, what is your conduct with the customer? What is your approach?\nAre you there, when the customer needs a loan? How you're dealing, is it transparent?\nSo the larger point is that you have to be convinced of the position, you are taking and you\nshould not be out-priced. So that is also very critical. Suddenly, you can't be an outlier in the\nmarket, when the world is giving at USD100, you can't be ending the USD50. So that we are\ncognizant of that. So there we keep on balancing and recalibrating and calibrating. But as of\nnow, we've chosen this path and we will keep on evaluating our position as we move ahead.\nRenish Bhuva: Okay. Got it, sir. Thank you so much, sir, and all the best.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sarvesh Gupta from Maximal Capital. Please\ngo ahead.\nSarvesh Gupta: Good evening, sir and congratulations on a good set of numbers. And sir, one question on the\ncost to income side. So where do you see it settling down? We had a little bit spike in this quarter.\nBut as you explained, it was because of employee cost maybe increments, but where do we want\nto settle it?\nShalabh Saxena: The sweet spot is more than north of 35% south of 40%. So once the things are stabilized, a\n37%, 38% is a good number to kind of operate in. Anything less would not be fair on the\nemployee and anything more is not fair on the balance sheet. So that is what, is our view. So\n37%, 38%, any number, which is between 35%, 36% to south of 40%. I mean any number\nstarting with 35% or until 39%, is a good number as for us.\nSarvesh Gupta: Understood. And on the ticket size question, so your number of borrowers as in Slide number 5,\nhas not increased much, maybe 12%, 13% up only Y-o-Y, while the AUM is up 60%. So overall\nticket size per client would have increased quite a lot, right? Y-o-Y, if we just do the average?\nAshish Damani: Yes, hi Sarvesh. Yes, what basically we have done is, we have kind of written off a lot of\nportfolio last year. And that has impacted a cleanup on the number of borrower side, since the\ncustomers had the small trail portfolio also coming from the COVID period and all. The amount\noutstanding adjustment probably was lower, but the number of customers is, anyway the\ndenominator kind of shrunk really big time. That's the impact that you see. But if you look at the\nnumber of customers, like Shalabh was explaining last year, 8.8 lakhs customers. This quarter,\n2.6 lakhs customers is what we have added.\nSo the number of borrowers will continue to increase from here on and the exposure piece will\nbe settled. Even if you look at with the current base, the average outstanding probably is around\nINR37,000, which is very much in line with the industry, in fact marginally lower compared to\nthe industry. So, we are very well placed there. The ticket size like we talked about, is a factor\nof what kinds of loans you do.\nWe have a very standard income-generating loans only, which as company, we are doing. In\nfact, most of our loans are two years. So the ticket size will be slightly higher compared to\npeople, who do, let's say, one-year loans or people who are doing, let's say, cross-sell loans,\nwhich are six months and all with much smaller ticket sizes.\nSo it's a factor of what is there in the denominator and numerator. For us, it's a plain vanilla\nincome-generating loans. And that's why probably ticket size stick to be a slightly higher\ncompared in fact, I would not say higher any more, it is in line with the industry. But if you look\nat the exposure, we will be marginally lower.\nSarvesh Gupta: Understood. And last quarter commentary was that our business as usual, ROA should be around\n4.5%. Now this quarter, we have already reached 6%. And there's scope for cost-to-income to\ngo down, NIM’s to improve, cost of funds to go down. You are also saying that your credit cost,\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nwhich was earlier from maybe 2% BAU now is in trending down to 1%, 1.5%. So is there a\nmajor upside on your ROAs from the current 6% as well?\nShalabh Saxena: So see, this is a business, where we don't know, what we don't know. So you still have to be\nagile, and it is always good to plan conservatively and not go overboard. This was the first\nquestion also, where I kind of gave a longish answer. We are and while you have not asked, but\nour comfort is 13.9%, 14% NIMs, cost-to-income of what I said, 35% to 39%. It's very important\nthat, our yields have gone up to 24%. They will stabilize at this number now because we had\nincreased our rates. I think, next quarter might be a slight delta up and then, it will stabilize\nbecause we haven't had a rate hike since the September or October of last year.\nSo stability is what we are looking for at this point in time, Sarvesh. And what we'll still calibrate.\nBut yes, the numbers are what they are. But on a steady state, what we were confident of is what\nwe told you, the 4.5% that we spoke about. And if it is more than it is good, but that much we'll\ndeliver for sure.\nSarvesh Gupta: Understood. And a final question on the employee hiring. So of course, you are adding the non-\nMFI portfolio as well as expanding rapidly in the last one quarter, two quarters. So what's been\nthe experience there because all the companies are doing quite well. So isn't it like very difficult\nto get talent at all levels to be done properly, you have just started expanding in the last one\nquarter or two quarters. And now the entire industry is firing up and everybody would have\npotentially a propensity to pay higher or retain, so in that scenario, how do we sort of operate\nwith our plans, which will mean a lot more branches and lot more employees and even in the\nnew product side?\nShalabh Saxena: So one of the key things is people, and we have to ensure that, we have people, who stay with\nus and are able to deliver quality. When it comes to employees at a branch level, which is a\nbranch manager and a loan officer. Loan officer, we will always have that standard churn. We\nwill have the churn, which is the standard 30%, 35%, 40%. Microfinance is all about robotic\nexecution of the plan. How you are able to execute the processes and how we are able to ensure\nthat, they see a future in you as an organization.\nFor whatever Spandana is, very happy to report that, over the past one year, we have got very\ngood talent. We've been able to attract very good talent, and this includes people at the branch\nlevel. And when I say branch level, the branch manager is a critical cog to this whole wheel.. A\nloan officer churn will happen. That is inevitable, but you have to control the branch managers\nchurn and or attrition that you have to, as an organization, ensure that your entire might is behind\nit.\nWe have taken various initiatives to ensure that, while there's a future in it, in this for everyone.\nBut if you are able to control the attrition at a branch manager level, you are sorted as an\ninstitution because the branch manager is the CEO of that entire geography of 30 kilometres,\n35-kilometres radius that he operates in, and he will ensure that, other things are set into place.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nFrom a pure philosophy perspective, I am not saying, we are there yet. But at a LO level, we\nshould hire freshers. These new geographies, where we are going, we are having -- we will kind\nof walk that part because we can't have completely new set of people, the entire network or the\nentire hierarchy can’t be new.\nSo we are doing some bit of lateral hiring. But however, when it comes to approach point of\nview, and we will get there sooner than later. The LO will have to be from the market without a\nmicro finance background. Your branch managers duty is to train the employee and ensure that,\nhe executes for you. This country is a 1.3 billion, 1.4 billion population. You'll have enough and\nmore people to kind of come to you, provided they see good enough money.\nA INR20,000 is the employee mix, good enough for their place, where they live. And our duty\nis to ensure, we create the environment so that, the career part is taken care of. We can have a\nseparate discussion on this, and that's why I said, we are not there yet because we are trying to\nopen new branches at a faster pace. But in a steady state, that is where we'll get to.\nSarvesh Gupta: Understood. And did I hear you right, when you said that, FY '24 target might be around\nINR10,750 crores, which is like a 25% AUM growth for this year?\nShalabh Saxena: Q3.\nSarvesh Gupta: Q3. Okay, understood. Thanks, Shalabh, and all the best for the coming quarters.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rohan from Agile Capital. Please go ahead.\nRohan: Yes, thank you for the opportunity. Congratulations on the good set of a numbers. I have two\nquestions. What is the stabilized ROA? Are we looking at the most probably financial year '25?\nSo you have guided for AUM for finance year '24 and financial year '25. I mean, what is your\ninternal estimate if you could?\nAshish Damani: Hi Rohan, So ROA I think, Shalabh just explained on the call, a little while back, we are\ncommitted to giving more than 4.5% ROA in stabilized or a BAU basis. Currently, the number\nanyway is trending higher than what we have committed for. I think, the way business is shaping\nup. We are very well placed to meet the guidance of 4.5% and the AUM of INR15,000 crores\nby FY'25. We don't see any hedge around any of these numbers, which we have committed.\nShalabh Saxena: Let me just supplement because I've been hearing this commentary. This is, we are not selling\nconsumer durables or commodities. This is finance, where you have to get the money back. It is\nvery critical that, you deliver quality. And hence, over a period, you will have those ups and\ndowns for sure. But as long as you are in the guidance of the sub 2%, during this conversation\nitself.\nI have quoted a number of 1.5%, 1.6% twice over. As long as you are in that range, you will see\nthis numbers going up, down marginally. But you have to operate in that range to deliver the\nnumber that we are talking of. As long as you are there, you should not be worried about it.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nWhile right now, the graph to the GNPAs and the SMAs, all of that is sliding down. You could\nsee in the future, some bit of some bps going up, it could further go down from here as well. All\nI'm trying to mention is that you will have those seasonal plays. You will those few issues here\nand there. But what is very critical is the larger point that you have to operate in that range,\nwhich is deliver quantity along with quality. As long as the framework, if you are able to deliver\nin that framework, which you came out with under the Vision '25, we should be fine. And that\nis what, we are focused on.\nRohan: Okay. The second question was, if you could just kind of highlight, which of the states are now\ndominating your disbursement for the quarter and also the portion of your overall loan book?\nShalabh Saxena: I think in the -- because this was a suggestion in the last call, somebody had I'm forgetting the\nname, Slide number 19 in the annexure, we have given the state wise split. So we have the --\nand it's a good question. I will extend with your permission, the question and I'll give you the\nanswer also. There are two states, 16% is Madhya Pradesh, 15% is Orissa.\nAnd then there are 11% and 10%. By end of FY '25, if all goes well, all the big ones should be\nanywhere in the range of 10% to 11%, at best 12%. That is our comfort zone. So comfort zone\nis 12% max contribution from a state. The plan is such, and that is why the focus on the seven\nstates because we don't have great market share. And those are good potential places.\nSo this year, in those seven states, we will end of the total AUM, we will have about 23% coming\nfrom these seven states. End of next year, which is FY '25, that will go about 44%-45%. So that\nis the overall larger picture. And this solves the concentration problem also, which is the end\nobjective, or which is the objective that we are running at and we will work our way to ensure\nthat is the number that we will be end of FY '25. We have already started seeing the results over\nthe past quarter, three quarters, in fact and this trend will continue.\nRohan: Yes. Thank you.\nModerator: Thank you. We take the next question from the line of Sagar Rungta from Anand Rathi. Please\ngo ahead.\nSagar Rungta: Good evening, Mr. Shalabh and Ashish. Just one question from my side. If you could give a\nbroad colour on the FOIR levels of your new customer acquisition from the focus states and a\ncap at which Spandana as an organization looks at?\nShalabh Saxena: FOIR levels. Did I hear you right?\nSagar Rungta: Yes.\nShalabh Saxena: So look, we work within the norms and whatever is allowable is what we will do because that\nyou can't really fight the -- there's no point. There is a clearly defined sensible and the right\napproach, which has been prescribed, and we will follow that. That's number one. What is in our\ncontrol are the levels of lending. And hence, we track the indebtedness level at a borrower and\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nnot the ticket size because in our view, booking a ticket size does not give the full picture. The\nindebtedness level at a customer has to be looked at, and that is what we track.\nAnd over a period of time, over the ticket sizes also as more and more we keep on and I think in\nthe beginning of the commentary, I have said that the seven states that we have started our\nbusiness, we operate on a lower ticket size. In fact, 80,000 on a cycle four customer is the max\nthat we give in Spandana, which will probably be one of the -- it is a lower number than the\nindustry.\nThe industry has already hit 1,00,000, 1,25,000 all kinds of numbers are floating around. We are\nnot ticket size players. We are not a higher ticket size player. You might lose out the customer.\nSo be it. Our experience is that a good relationship and a transparent conduct drives the\nrelationship, not a ticket size for that matter. And that is what, we'll keep on pursuing.\nSo the larger question is, what is the compromise you are doing, when you operate in this\nsegment? We focus on the JLG. In fact, as I said the last time, we've been making this point. All\nthe new branches that we are opening anywhere now, are weekly models. So that is our belief\nin the system and the JLG is something that we strongly believe in. So we will continue to pursue\nthis. Ticket size is something that, never gets us excited. And for whatever reason, we kind of\ntend to shy away from that.\nSagar Rungta: Yes, sir, my question was more in terms of a broad idea on the FOIR levels of the customers?\nShalabh Saxena: So we can, I don't have the data handy, but it's a very black-and-white. If you're in stock, what\nare you allowed? You are allowed INR1,50,000 at a household level of the installment. That's\nthe max. This is a practice that I have heard that people have started increasing the tenure of the\nloans to kind of fit into this. Once again, not a great fan of this idea.\nThis is an unsecured lending, unsecured lending 24 months is the max that one should look at.\nAnd at this point in time, we will hold on to this these. The FOIR level, so if they qualify, we\nget you the numbers if you want. What you want to know is, how much is the headway within\nthat customer's household. correct? That's the question in a different way, right?\nSagar Rungta: Yes, sir.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So we don't have the numbers right now. We'll find it out.\nSagar Rungta: No worry, sir. I'll take off-line, sir. Thank you, sir.\nModerator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraint, we take the last question. This was\nthe last question. I would now like to hand the conference back to the management for their\nclosing remarks. Over to you all.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So thank you for attending this call. I thank every single person, who has at different points\nin time have engaged with us, and they have given their advice to us in terms of various elements,\nsomething related to business, something which is outside of business and so on and so forth.\nPlease continue supporting us. And we, from our side, have a very clearly, defined way forward\nuntil FY '25. And vision 2025 is what is driving us and we'll continue to tread our path. Quantity\nwith quality is what we will focus on, and that is what we are working on. So thank you very\nmuch. Thank you.\nModerator: Thank you. On behalf of Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited That concludes this conference.\nThank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.\n****\n",

Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Shalabh Saxena, CEO and Managing\nDirector. Thank you, and over to you, sir.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you very much. Good evening to all of you. Thank you for taking time out to attend our\nearnings call. This is the fifth quarter of the new management in Spandana and I am satisfied to\nstate that we've come a long way from a year back when in July 2022, we had presented our\nVision 2025. Since then, we've received a lot of valuable feedback, suggestions and advice from\nall the stakeholders for which we are very grateful. Please have the suggestions and advice\nflowing our way, we need them.\nAs you are aware, we had identified five priorities for us as a management team when we\npresented Vision’25. We have made significant progress on each of the five priorities, and I\nwould start by providing an update on those. Number one and most important-\nPeople, reinforcing senior and middle management team.: As announced in our last earnings\ncall, we now have all the 13 key positions filled and all the minus 1 levels are also adequately\nstaffed. Thus, our senior leadership hiring agenda now stands complete with a strong\nmanagement team in place. Our focus now is on setting-up employee centric people practices\nwith the aim to make Spandana a preferred employer. We have started work on this already. And\nin the next two quarters to three quarters, we intend to make progress on this key agenda item.\nThe second point was strengthen governance risk and control with added focus on refining\nprocesses. A lot of our efforts in the previous year were dedicated in refining and further\nstrengthening governance, risk and control. We have been calibrating our exposure norms,\ntweaking policies where necessary to add strength to our governance framework. Streamlining\nprocesses was also a major focus area during the last five quarters. This is a continuous process,\nand we will keep working on it consistently.\nNumber three, focus on customer acquisition-led business growth, while ensuring retention of\ngood existing customers. We continue to drive growth through member acquisition. We had\nadded 8.8 lakh new borrowers during FY '23, which is last year. In the current quarter as well,\nwe've added 2.6 lakh new borrowers. As we expand the new geographies, our new borrower\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nadditions will continue to trend higher. By end of the year, we intend acquiring more than 1\nmillion new customers, thus taking our customer base upwards of 3 million or thereabouts.\nPoint number four, technology scale up to deliver an end-to-end paperless process for customers.\nWe are continuously scouting for and investing in technology to make our systems robust and\nprocess simple for our employees and customers. Our focus has been an agile LOS and LMS\nand most importantly, a safe and secure back end. We believe that technology will drive the next\nwave of growth.\nPoint number five, customer-focused initiatives with emphasis on products and service. We had\nenvisaged a non-micro finance loan book of over INR2,000 crores by FY '25 and are taking\nconcrete steps in that direction. We have introduced loan against property in the new geography\nof Rajasthan. We will soon be launching the Nano enterprise loans in select markets. We look\nforward to scaling up these product offerings in multiple markets in the coming quarters. This is\napart from the INR15,000 crores of book in micro finance, which we have planned end of FY\n'25.\nApart from the five priorities, we are well possessed of the fact that there is a large scope for\nbuilding efficiencies in our distribution network. We are taking a number of steps to ensure right\nutilization of resources. We anticipate a 15% to 20% improvement in efficiencies in the current\ndistribution metrics that we operate and over the next two quarters to three quarters, we will see\nthe benefits play out. Our focus on growing in the seven states, which were Rajasthan, UP, Bihar,\nHaryana, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Gujarat where we have a very low market share\ncontinues to gain ground.\nOver the past two quarters, we opened a net 188 branches, most of which are in these focus\nstates. We want Spandana to have a meaningful share of microfinance portfolio in these states.\nA large portion of our loan book and borrower addition growth is expected to come out of these\nseven states.\nAs is there in the presentation, about 26% of new borrowers added during the quarter were from\nthese seven focus states. While some of our initiatives result in immediate impact during the\nquarter, many others will take a quarter or two to translate into tangible results. But I can say\nthis with reasonable surety that we are on the right track.\nHaving said that, let me present the results of Q1 FY '24. The results and the investor presentation\nhave already uploaded on the NSE, BSE websites. I'm sure you would have gone through, but\nI'll quickly go through the results.\nDisbursements, as you are aware, Q1 is usually a seasonally low quarter for the microfinance\nindustry. We disbursed INR1,664 crores during the quarter, up 26% Y-o-Y. On AUM, we ended\nthe quarter at an AUM of INR8,848 crores, an all-time high for Spandana. This was 60% growth\nY-o-Y and a growth of 4% over the previous quarter.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nCustomer acquisition. One of the strong pillars of our Vision 2025 is customer acquisition-led\ngrowth strategy. During the quarter, we added close to 2.6 lakh new borrowers, which is 144%\nhigher than the same quarter previous year.\nOn the borrowing side, you are aware this is the key component of any NBFC and its\nfunctioning. The quarter saw a total borrowing of INR1,540 crores, up INR894 crores from last\nyear Q1. Our marginal cost of borrowings was slightly lower at 12.3% as against 12.6% in Q4\nFY 23. Weighted average cost of borrowing was largely stable at 12.5%, up by 9 bps\noverQ4FY23. We continue to strengthen relationships with our borrowers while continuously\nhaving dialogue with other lender partners.\nOn the portfolio quality: Our portfolio quality continues to improve over the quarters. The\nstandard, which is the current book is at 97.1%, an improvement from 96.6% over the previous\nquarter and a marked improvement from 68.4% in Q4 of FY '22. The 1-90 bucket is 1.36% now,\nwhich was 1.54% in Q4 of FY '23. Of the 1-90 book 40%, that is 0.55% is in 1-30 bucket.\nThe GNPA end of Q1 FY '24 now stands at 1.63% and the NNPA is 0.49% on the back of\nimproved quality and higher provisioning. Of the GNPA pool, about 42% is contributed by pre-\nApril '21 book, which itself is 1.2% of the loan book now.\nOn the collection efficiency front, net collection efficiency for the period was 98.1% as against\n97.6% in Q4. We continue to see improvements in net collection efficiency, which is a very\nhealthy sign. Gross collection efficiency for the quarter was 101.5%. Our focus at the distribution\nlevel is net, because that is the timely repayment and that is what we are driving as a team.\nFinancials for Q4. We continue to maintain a provision coverage of 70.1% on the consolidated\nbook in the current quarter, and NNPA has reduced to 0.49% and GNPA improved to 1.63%.\nThe number for the previous quarter were 2.07% and 0.64%. Our yield on the portfolio has\nimproved to 24% from normalized yield of 22.8% in quarter 4 and 16.4% in Q1 of FY '23.\nNIM is 14.2%. That is up 38 basis points over normalized NIM of last quarter and 434 bps over\nquarter 1 of FY ‘23. Total income for the quarter increased 104% to INR527 crores versus\nINR259 crores in Q1 of FY ‘23. Net interest income was up 102% to INR328 crores for the\nquarter was INR162 crores in quarter 1 FY ‘23.\nPPOP for the quarter was INR189 crores, up to 273% over INR51 crores reported for the same\nquarter previous year. PBT for the quarter was INR161 crores, PAT INR119 crores, which is an\nincrease of 13% sequentially over the past quarter. We had reported a loss of INR220 crores\nduring the same quarter of previous year, owing to a write-off of the INR702 crores that we have\ndone in Q1, as all of you are aware.\nSo to summarize, we have the building blocks in place and now are completely focused on\nexecution and delivery of our Vision 2025 targets. This year is all about efficiencies, productivity\nand refining processes. Our plans for having 1,500 operational branches by end of FY '25 is on\ntrack.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nAnd over the past six months, we've opened, as I said earlier, 188 branches. We continue to build\nthe distribution where we feel there are opportunities obviously, quality of the specific\ngeography drives our decision making. We continue to experience strong economic tailwinds in\nour markets, driving demand for micro loans. We continue to be cautiously optimistic about the\ngrowth potential of the microfinance industry in India.\nI thank all the stakeholders of Spandana, the Board, our lenders and our colleagues in Spandana,\nwho pulled in their energies during the year. A special note of thanks to all the branch staff, our\nloan offices, branch managers and the entire field staff who work hard day in and day out to\ndeliver the results that collectively all of us have envisaged.\nThank you very much to all of you on the call. You have been a constant source of\nencouragement by giving us positive advice feedback and, of course, support during the year.\nWe look forward to receiving similar encouragement in the future.\nWe have the entire management team with us and are ready to take questions from you. Thank\nyou very much.\nModerator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We take the first\nquestion from the line of Shreepal Doshi from Equirus. Please go ahead.\nShreepal Doshi: Sir, congrats on a good set of numbers. I had the first question on the collection efficiency. So\nwe see that collection efficiency for MFI lenders are ranging between 98% to 99%. So is it fair\nto assume that this is the new normal for the sector post COVID now? And therefore, the credit\ncost would also broadly be increasing to say 1% to 2%?\nShalabh Saxena: See, for the -- so there are two questions that you asked in that one question. The first is net\ncollection efficiency is a timely repayment and sometimes the payment comes with a lag. The\npayment comes with a lag for various reasons. It is sometimes a company-driven thing also, the\nemployee might be on leave, etc. So there are various layers in this whole thing. The credit cost\nif you have to look at, you have to look at it in the context of whether you're receiving the\npayment or not and that is where you should look at gross collection efficiency.\nOn the timely repayment, which is the fundamental discipline of micro finance, the net collection\nefficiency is what we are driving amongst our teams. To answer your question, Shreepal, 99%\nis what we are targeting in the short term. Is it a new norm, maybe at this point in time, -- while\nwe built in all our financial credit cost of 2%, we anticipate the number to be lower, a 1%-1.25%.\nAny company and not just us.any good company if it runs its model well; it should not deliver a\ncredit loss of1.5% or maybe 1.6%, that's it. So that's our take on this whole thing. We obviously\nhave done some conservative estimates on the credit loss valuations, and that's where we are.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it, sir. Thank you. The second question was you highlighted about tech initiatives. So what\nis the capex or expense that we are likely to incurred over the next one year for these initiatives?\nAnd then on the opex, even during quarter, the employee cost was significantly higher on a\nsequential basis. So what explains that?\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nShalabh Saxena: Employee cost.\nAshish Damani: Hi Shreepal, this is Ashish, this side. The employee costs are higher because we had gone\nthrough our annual increment cycle, and there is also a headcount increase, which has happened\nbetween last quarter, around March and then again in this quarter as well for the branches that\nwe have rolled out. So those are the two parameters which have kind of added to the cost. But\nas we go along, the employee cost change on a sequential quarter basis should normalize because\nthis was more of an annual increment exercise, Thus, you are seeing a jump between previous\nquarter and this quarter.\nShalabh Saxena: On the second question, which is this year, our IT cost is about INR75 crores of split into a capex\nof about INR20 crores and the balance is opex. We have budgeted this adequately until FY '25,\nand we will do another three years excise next year when we'll kind of bake the future years as\nwell into this.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it, sir. Sir, just last question. With respect to the income revaluation that we have to do as\nper the RBI norms. So if there is any household which has got household income of more than\nINR3 lakh. Firstly, what is the process that we have deployed for evaluating the household\nincome, and secondly if there is any household income who is making more than INR3 lakh then\ndo we have a product for that customer?\nShalabh Saxena: At this point in time, Shreepal, and in our various commentaries, we've been stressing the fact\nthat we are very basic bread-and-butter people. We don't want to deviate and hence, the right\nanswer to this question is that we will put them under the non-PSL, non-qualifying assets and\nbook them. But as of now, we are not approaching them. I mean, if it doesn't fall then the lady\nis out. We don't source that case because as I said, last year and this year, we are just sticking to\nthe fundamentals of business. And given the fact that we are doing the JLG model of micro\nfinance, that is what we are foreseeing.\nModerator: Thank you. We take the next question from the line of Manuj Oberoi from YES Securities.\nPlease go ahead.\nRajiv Mehta: Yes. Hi, sir, this is Rajiv. Congratulations on very strong set of numbers. My first question is on\ngrowth. So sir, were there any specific operational changes still implemented in this first quarter\nbecause when I look at disbursement, there seem to be lower even adjusted for seasonality. So\nthat is one.\nAnd another related question is, is there any change in duration of the portfolio over the last two\nquarters because I see portfolio run off in this quarter being slightly slower than usual?\nShalabh Saxena: So the second part of your question I understood. Can you just repeat the first part? Sorry, I\ndidn't understand.\nRajiv Mehta: Yes. So were there any specific operational changes on the ground, which also led to a lower\ndisbursement in this quarter, besides your own seasonality?\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nShalabh Saxena: So Manoj. we have a defined goal in mind. Rajiv.\nRajiv Mehta: Yes, Rajiv, this side, yes.\nShalabh Saxena: So Rajiv, we have a defined goal in mind on FY '24 and FY '25. As you've seen in the\npresentation, we are already at INR8,848 crores. We are very close to about the INR9,000 mark\njust about INR150 crores. We are in no hurry to report. Microfinance is all about pacing your\ninnings. Microfinance is not a T20.\nMicrofinance is a test match. And the test match has to last a full five days, don't have to end the\ntest in three days or four days. We know exactly what we are doing just because there is an\nopportunity, where you cannot or should not change or alter your plan. We are cognizant that --\nand I will repeat this Microfinance is a risk management business. It is not an asset business.\nIt is important that the teams on the ground are culturally aligned to the sense of responsibility\nthat you do not as an institution deviate on the quality that you're sourcing. Hence, I heard your\nquestion or rather your observation, my view is that we know exactly where we have to end and\nwe've given the last call also, there was a point on this. We are in no hurry to end the match in\nthree days.\nOur goal defined this year and next year, which is INR15,000 crores in FY '25 is fixed. It could\nbe a few INR100 crores here and there. In all likelihood, it will be over. But very difficult to\nkind of stick our neck out and say instead of 15, we'll do 17. There is no need. So past is enough\nhistory that if you are not cautious, you end up burning your fingers, hands and everything. So\nthat is very clear. We'll pace our innings to ensure that the quality is delivered and that is what\nwe are doing.\nSo we had said in the last call that we as an institution has to very, very clearly deliver quality\napart from the top line as well. And if you would have followed our numbers over the past four\nquarters that we've been coming here. That's a testimony of the fact. So cautious lending is the\nright approach in my view. Quarter 1 either way, this is what was the plan and we are just about\nthere.\nRajiv Mehta: Okay. Got that. And now the question is on NIM outlook because -- so what is the space for the\nportfolio yield are moving up because it has moved pretty significantly in the last two quarters.\nAnd secondly, the other variable for NIM will be the cost of funds and I see marginal cost of\nfunds coming down and we also raising sizeable coming up money at lower cost. So basis the\nexpected movement in cost of funds over the next few quarters and maybe more residual re-\npricing of portfolio, where do you think NIMs can go to?\nAshish Damani: Hi Rajiv. Good evening. Yes, there is a quarter or two more for our NIM's to see at least around\nthe same number or small expansion as well, primarily on account of yield probably inching-up\na little bit more given that we've been lending at 25%, there is a little headroom there. We are\npresently at 24% yield and you would never hit the 25%, but there is still a little bit of headroom\nthere. So a quarter or two, you may continue to see some inching up.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nOn the cost of fund side, I think we've seen a drop last quarter. We hope to see a little more drop\ngiven that as an institution, we have been having a consistent performance for the last five\nquarters now. I think there is a scope of improvement in terms of how or what kind of pricing\nthat we are borrowing at. So yes, we are positively inclined to maintain the NIMs at the current\nlevels.\nRajiv Mehta: Sure. Ashish, can I just ask one more question before I move back?\nAshish Damani: Sure. Go ahead.\nRajiv Mehta: It is on the provisioning line. So there's a INR26 crores provision made against receivables from\nassignment portfolio. It can’t be against that direct assignment portfolio, right? So what is it\npertaining to?\nAshish Damani: So this is a direct assignment only. So there were certain customers where the collections did\nnot go through. And during the period (IT disruption), earlier period, when we did not have the\nIT or whatever information we kind of have paid in advance to the banks. We are still trying to\ncollect it from the customers. As a prudence, we have kind of provided against that portfolio just\nto have a clean set of books.\nRajiv Mehta: Yes. So any more hit likely, yes, or we are done with this?\nAshish Damani: We still have about INR24 crores of portfolio, which is there on balance sheet, which we will\nhave to see and calibrate as we go along.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sagar Tanna from Alchemy Ventures. Please\ngo ahead.\nSagar Tanna: Hi, sir. If I heard you correctly, you expect credit cost to be 1.5%-1.6% for the year, is that\ncorrect?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes.\nSagar Tanna: But what is the outlook because we still keep getting mix commentaries with respect to rural\nrecovery, etc, what is your outlook in terms of how the economy is shaping up on that side of\nthe country?\nShalabh Saxena: So look, the credit demand is very strong, and we have seen a lot of turnaround from a quality\npoint of view. So that is the heartening fact in this whole micro finance story. So micro finance\nover a period of time has seen lots of ups and downs. And post-COVID, a year now a year, 1.5\nyears, that it has seen strong tailwinds, both from the economy point of view and the heavy\ninvestment that the government is doing infrastructurally in the Bharat of India.\nSo from a quality point of view, I think if you run the operations well, the number that I said\nshould hold that unless there are some unforeseen, unknown issues, which might not kind of\nfavour the industry. As far as the industry is concerned, concentration risk is very, very\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nimportant. And as an enterprise, we are ensuring that we walk the steps to ensure the\nconcentrations are moderated across the states where you see the elevated levels on the market\nshare and the contribution that a specific state does give to us.\nSo that is what we are working at, and until FY '25, right now, we have a couple of states that\n14%- 15% contribution. We have a clear plan to get them down to 11%-12%. So in our estimate,\ncombination of concentration, plus good execution of the model. Relying on JLG to ensure that\nthere's a safety net are the critical components of this model. And I can say this is a reasonable\nsurety that if all of these are done well, there’s a good chance that as an enterprise, we will stand\nto gain on this.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jignesh Shial from InCred Capital. Please go\nahead.\nJignesh Shial: I have two questions. One, has there been any write-off during the quarter? And any recoveries\nfrom the previous written-off quarter, any number on that you have it?\nAshish Damani: Yes. So write-off for the quarter is driven by the policy that we have taken up last quarter, which\nis any loans, which move into 455-plus days, will be moved to technical write-offs. The number\nwas INR21 crores. The impact of this was around INR5.8 crores in the P&L. In terms of\nrecovery, the total recovery that we had was INR23 crores across the write-off.\nShalabh Saxena: So of the INR700 crores and other write-offs that we have done, we've collected all put together\nabout INR90 crores is the specific question that you asked from the time we started this journey.\nJignesh Shial: Understood. That's very helpful. And secondly, you've been doing pretty good on the MFI side.\nAnd as you rightly pointed out earlier that more-and-more focus would be on incremental\nbranches and states I asked the same question last time as well. But if you can brief out a little\nbit more in detail about other than MFI businesses, how we are shaping up and how we are\nseeing that things are opening over next two years? But at least how are the beginning has been\nthere, if you can give some idea on it that could be really helpful other than your MFI business.\nShalabh Saxena: So Jignesh, we will -- it's early for us to -- I mean, we started booking loans on the LAP side.\nWe will launch the Nano enterprise, which is the small ticket loans to retailers. A 60,000 ticket\nsize is the number that we will start with it is a non-JLG business. That should start in this\nquarter. These two businesses this year is testing the waters and seeing how it goes. These are\npretty fast moving. There is an opportunity, a lot of opportunity, and we'll continue to focus on\nthe lower ticket sizes.\nI mean, we are not intending to give loans of INR20 lakhs, INR25 lakhs on the LAP, for example.\nSweet spot is INR5 lakh to INR7 lakhs. And on the Nano enterprise, I said our loans will be at\nINR60,000 to INR1 lakh. So there is tremendous demand for these loans because this is the\nmissing segment. The banks don't go after them and their business mostly survive on borrowings\nfrom friends and relatives.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nOnce again being unsecured in nature, at least the Nano enterprise, we have to be cautious and\nthat is what we will. On the LAP side, it obviously is a secured business. And that we are\nfocusing on productivity. There's a slightly longish gestation period business. Its not a MFI\nbusiness, which turns around very fast. But it holds tremendous promise for the profile of\ncustomers and the segments that we have identified. And maybe next quarter, when we come,\nwe will have more colour on this because we'll have some volumes backing whatever we speak\nright now it is insignificant volume to kind of give any commentary on.\nJignesh Shial: Understood. But just one thing that this will be all focused on the new customer base altogether,\nright? Not to the existing ones\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So absolutely. And what we have done is that we have opened a separate set of branches\nwe are not cutting corners by putting them into MFI branches because ultimately, it is the same\ninstitution. But we are very clear. We are not making the model fungible, we are not cutting\ncorners. The places where to open a branch is a factor of the geography and the potential and\nhas nothing to do with whether Spandana is around or not.\nI mean the Spandana MFI is around or not. It is a completely new set from a Chief Business\nOfficer down to the Loan Officer. It is a complete separate team it works differently. It works\nand the hirings have been done from the industry so that they have a fair colour of how this\nplayed out. It's a new business for us, but it holds a lot of promise. The new business that we\nhave launched in the state of Rajasthan, I don’t know, you are aware or not, but when we took\nover this book, this is not a new business for Spandana because this was being done in Andhra\nand Telangana. We had a book of about INR117 crores when I had taken over.\nAnd now it is around INR51 crores, INR52 crores. So it has run down because we were looking\nfor a good LMS and LOS. We wanted to do business properly and just because the opportunity\nwas goodwe really did not hurry into launching this business. we were servicing our existing\nbook. We stopped all disbursements for a year. That is why the book run down from INR117\ncrores to INR51 crores.\nNow we have started in a different state, which is Rajasthan, which is supposedly a fertile\ngeography for this kind of a setup because the customers are evolved there. And we see a lot of\navailable demand and untapped demand in this market in this segment, and that is what we will\ncontinue to progress on.\nJignesh Shial: Understood. And is it fair to assume that the yield on this new segment would be lower than\nyour typical MFI portfolio, but the tenure would be longer one. So the EMI will become more\nstickier?\nShalabh Saxena: That's correct. Yes, that's correct. Absolutely.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Renish from ICICI Securities. Please go ahead.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nRenish: Yes. Hi, Shalabh and Ashish, congrats for good set of numbers. Sir, just two questions from my\nside. One, you've been on the qualitative side since we have started this journey of weekly\ncollection model so of the total MFI branches which are on the weekly collection, is there any\nsplit, let's say, how much of this would be earlier into monthly model?\nShalabh Saxena: No. So the new branches, Renish, that we are opening irrespective of the states will be weekly.\nThat is number one. Number two, for a customer who you contracted at a monthly, it would be\nunfair for us to work weekly path because it might not happen. So we have clearly laid out plan\nin terms of how do you convert or rather phase. How do you phase out the current monthly\nmodel across the branches because we have three sets of branches. Branches, which are low on\nAUM, medium AUM and very big branches.\nThe very big branches are at some 285 or 286 numbers, our of the 1,100, 1,200. Those branches,\nwe will not touch this year. There's other things that we are doing, but they will remain monthly.\nThe other branches, we have a phase-wise plan on how do you kind of recalibrate them to convert\nthem into a weekly. Because by definition, about 60%, 70% in a steady state business will go to\nour existing customer.\nAnd if you keep on booking a monthly loan, this will never really work. So you’ll never be able\nto depart from the monthly. So we are believers in the weekly model, just as we are strong\nbelievers in the JLG. So there are clearly articulated plan internally that we have on how are we\ngoing to move the existing set of monthly branches into weekly.\nRenish Bhuva: Okay. And like, say, while implementing this, have you witnessed any, let's say, pushback from\nthe client or the staff where we might see some pushback in implementing weekly model?\nShalabh Saxena: Weekly model. So what are we attempting to do, Renish. We are attempting to do all the three\nthings, which is a customer acquisition, a collection and a disbursement. All the three things,\nevery single day of the 20 working days that you have, 20, 21. The new set of branches that we\nhave opened is a fresh staff, and that is a easier one. I mean, most of our team members do realize\nand any event such as a COVID or maybe a demonetization which happened many years back.\nIn case whenever there are challenges in the environment, weekly customers isn the weekly\nmodel comes out of a crisis much quicker than the others because the liability at least at the EMI\nlevel is very nominal of INR600, INR650 instead of the INR2,400, INR2,500.\nNow the point is that -- so the answer to your question is, we've got very good support from our\npeople. The plan was made, taking them very much on board in terms of how they are doing.\nPlus what happens is that when it comes to a Monday to Friday, Monday to Friday rigour--\nRenish. What happens is the staff gets a Saturday, Sunday, which is much more relaxed rather\nthan the earlier regimented approach of a Saturday, Sunday because we had a different collection\nmodel of 1, to 10. So the long answer to your question, we have got very good support because\nwe took them into confidence before walking this path. And now obviously, we are progressing\non that.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nRenish Bhuva: Got it. And sir, secondly, on the, let's say, growth side. So we have seen most of the companies\nreporting better numbers in Q1 despite being seasonally weak quarter. And if I recall our\nguidance for ‘24, ‘25, we had laid down a year back. I think since then the industry or is the\nbusiness cycle has changed dramatically. So would you like to give, let's say, a revised guidance\nor any commentary on the guidance, which you have put down on your back?\nShalabh Saxena: So if you look at our numbers, we ended the last year at INR8,511 crores. We are at INR8,848\ncrores now. If all goes as per plan, we will hit the INR10,000 crores number in either the last\nmonth of this quarter or the first month of the next quarter. So we should end the year at about\nto INR11,750 crores to INR12,000 crores, roughly, that is the number that we are looking at,\nwhich works out to in my mind, more decent Y-o-Y growth for FY.\nThis growth is coming from the new areas. So that is very, very critical. We are opening those\nnew geographies, new branches, which will kind of deliver the numbers that we are talking to.\nEarlier also, we've stated this position that we are not great fans of big ticket sizes. We'll continue\nto deliver loans in small packets. -- and that is, what we are planning to do. That is why the\nnumbers on the customer acquisition side you would have seen.\nMaybe two quarters from now, we will evaluate the movement on the ticket sizes. I understand\nthere's inflationary 6% increase, that I ideally one should be doing on a ticket size to stay at par.\nBut, at this point in time, we are not facing any resistance either from the customer or our\nemployees. And we are happy that way. We are clear that, more number of customers is the way\nto go, and not really…\nAshish Damani: In fact, Renish I'll just add a point about what Shalabh was trying to allude to. If you look at our\nticket sizes, this quarter, the weekly is coming into play now, given that, we have weekly\nbusiness at 35,000 in the first ticket size instead of 42000, which we do in a monthly setup. And\nthat has impacted our average ticket sizes. It is marginally lower compared to last quarter. It is\naround 41,000 compared to 42,000 plus last quarter.\nShalabh Saxena: So Renish, if you see within our company, we are following two ticket sizes. But then in our\nticket -- in a cycle one, monthly, our ticket size is 40,000 in a weekly model, whichever the 188\nbranches that we have opened, the ticket size is 35,000, and that's the start point. So we are\nconvinced that, you don't loose a customer for INR3,000, INR5,000. There are other things,\nwhich come into play, which is, what is your conduct with the customer? What is your approach?\nAre you there, when the customer needs a loan? How you're dealing, is it transparent?\nSo the larger point is that you have to be convinced of the position, you are taking and you\nshould not be out-priced. So that is also very critical. Suddenly, you can't be an outlier in the\nmarket, when the world is giving at USD100, you can't be ending the USD50. So that we are\ncognizant of that. So there we keep on balancing and recalibrating and calibrating. But as of\nnow, we've chosen this path and we will keep on evaluating our position as we move ahead.\nRenish Bhuva: Okay. Got it, sir. Thank you so much, sir, and all the best.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sarvesh Gupta from Maximal Capital. Please\ngo ahead.\nSarvesh Gupta: Good evening, sir and congratulations on a good set of numbers. And sir, one question on the\ncost to income side. So where do you see it settling down? We had a little bit spike in this quarter.\nBut as you explained, it was because of employee cost maybe increments, but where do we want\nto settle it?\nShalabh Saxena: The sweet spot is more than north of 35% south of 40%. So once the things are stabilized, a\n37%, 38% is a good number to kind of operate in. Anything less would not be fair on the\nemployee and anything more is not fair on the balance sheet. So that is what, is our view. So\n37%, 38%, any number, which is between 35%, 36% to south of 40%. I mean any number\nstarting with 35% or until 39%, is a good number as for us.\nSarvesh Gupta: Understood. And on the ticket size question, so your number of borrowers as in Slide number 5,\nhas not increased much, maybe 12%, 13% up only Y-o-Y, while the AUM is up 60%. So overall\nticket size per client would have increased quite a lot, right? Y-o-Y, if we just do the average?\nAshish Damani: Yes, hi Sarvesh. Yes, what basically we have done is, we have kind of written off a lot of\nportfolio last year. And that has impacted a cleanup on the number of borrower side, since the\ncustomers had the small trail portfolio also coming from the COVID period and all. The amount\noutstanding adjustment probably was lower, but the number of customers is, anyway the\ndenominator kind of shrunk really big time. That's the impact that you see. But if you look at the\nnumber of customers, like Shalabh was explaining last year, 8.8 lakhs customers. This quarter,\n2.6 lakhs customers is what we have added.\nSo the number of borrowers will continue to increase from here on and the exposure piece will\nbe settled. Even if you look at with the current base, the average outstanding probably is around\nINR37,000, which is very much in line with the industry, in fact marginally lower compared to\nthe industry. So, we are very well placed there. The ticket size like we talked about, is a factor\nof what kinds of loans you do.\nWe have a very standard income-generating loans only, which as company, we are doing. In\nfact, most of our loans are two years. So the ticket size will be slightly higher compared to\npeople, who do, let's say, one-year loans or people who are doing, let's say, cross-sell loans,\nwhich are six months and all with much smaller ticket sizes.\nSo it's a factor of what is there in the denominator and numerator. For us, it's a plain vanilla\nincome-generating loans. And that's why probably ticket size stick to be a slightly higher\ncompared in fact, I would not say higher any more, it is in line with the industry. But if you look\nat the exposure, we will be marginally lower.\nSarvesh Gupta: Understood. And last quarter commentary was that our business as usual, ROA should be around\n4.5%. Now this quarter, we have already reached 6%. And there's scope for cost-to-income to\ngo down, NIM’s to improve, cost of funds to go down. You are also saying that your credit cost,\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nwhich was earlier from maybe 2% BAU now is in trending down to 1%, 1.5%. So is there a\nmajor upside on your ROAs from the current 6% as well?\nShalabh Saxena: So see, this is a business, where we don't know, what we don't know. So you still have to be\nagile, and it is always good to plan conservatively and not go overboard. This was the first\nquestion also, where I kind of gave a longish answer. We are and while you have not asked, but\nour comfort is 13.9%, 14% NIMs, cost-to-income of what I said, 35% to 39%. It's very important\nthat, our yields have gone up to 24%. They will stabilize at this number now because we had\nincreased our rates. I think, next quarter might be a slight delta up and then, it will stabilize\nbecause we haven't had a rate hike since the September or October of last year.\nSo stability is what we are looking for at this point in time, Sarvesh. And what we'll still calibrate.\nBut yes, the numbers are what they are. But on a steady state, what we were confident of is what\nwe told you, the 4.5% that we spoke about. And if it is more than it is good, but that much we'll\ndeliver for sure.\nSarvesh Gupta: Understood. And a final question on the employee hiring. So of course, you are adding the non-\nMFI portfolio as well as expanding rapidly in the last one quarter, two quarters. So what's been\nthe experience there because all the companies are doing quite well. So isn't it like very difficult\nto get talent at all levels to be done properly, you have just started expanding in the last one\nquarter or two quarters. And now the entire industry is firing up and everybody would have\npotentially a propensity to pay higher or retain, so in that scenario, how do we sort of operate\nwith our plans, which will mean a lot more branches and lot more employees and even in the\nnew product side?\nShalabh Saxena: So one of the key things is people, and we have to ensure that, we have people, who stay with\nus and are able to deliver quality. When it comes to employees at a branch level, which is a\nbranch manager and a loan officer. Loan officer, we will always have that standard churn. We\nwill have the churn, which is the standard 30%, 35%, 40%. Microfinance is all about robotic\nexecution of the plan. How you are able to execute the processes and how we are able to ensure\nthat, they see a future in you as an organization.\nFor whatever Spandana is, very happy to report that, over the past one year, we have got very\ngood talent. We've been able to attract very good talent, and this includes people at the branch\nlevel. And when I say branch level, the branch manager is a critical cog to this whole wheel.. A\nloan officer churn will happen. That is inevitable, but you have to control the branch managers\nchurn and or attrition that you have to, as an organization, ensure that your entire might is behind\nit.\nWe have taken various initiatives to ensure that, while there's a future in it, in this for everyone.\nBut if you are able to control the attrition at a branch manager level, you are sorted as an\ninstitution because the branch manager is the CEO of that entire geography of 30 kilometres,\n35-kilometres radius that he operates in, and he will ensure that, other things are set into place.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nFrom a pure philosophy perspective, I am not saying, we are there yet. But at a LO level, we\nshould hire freshers. These new geographies, where we are going, we are having -- we will kind\nof walk that part because we can't have completely new set of people, the entire network or the\nentire hierarchy can’t be new.\nSo we are doing some bit of lateral hiring. But however, when it comes to approach point of\nview, and we will get there sooner than later. The LO will have to be from the market without a\nmicro finance background. Your branch managers duty is to train the employee and ensure that,\nhe executes for you. This country is a 1.3 billion, 1.4 billion population. You'll have enough and\nmore people to kind of come to you, provided they see good enough money.\nA INR20,000 is the employee mix, good enough for their place, where they live. And our duty\nis to ensure, we create the environment so that, the career part is taken care of. We can have a\nseparate discussion on this, and that's why I said, we are not there yet because we are trying to\nopen new branches at a faster pace. But in a steady state, that is where we'll get to.\nSarvesh Gupta: Understood. And did I hear you right, when you said that, FY '24 target might be around\nINR10,750 crores, which is like a 25% AUM growth for this year?\nShalabh Saxena: Q3.\nSarvesh Gupta: Q3. Okay, understood. Thanks, Shalabh, and all the best for the coming quarters.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rohan from Agile Capital. Please go ahead.\nRohan: Yes, thank you for the opportunity. Congratulations on the good set of a numbers. I have two\nquestions. What is the stabilized ROA? Are we looking at the most probably financial year '25?\nSo you have guided for AUM for finance year '24 and financial year '25. I mean, what is your\ninternal estimate if you could?\nAshish Damani: Hi Rohan, So ROA I think, Shalabh just explained on the call, a little while back, we are\ncommitted to giving more than 4.5% ROA in stabilized or a BAU basis. Currently, the number\nanyway is trending higher than what we have committed for. I think, the way business is shaping\nup. We are very well placed to meet the guidance of 4.5% and the AUM of INR15,000 crores\nby FY'25. We don't see any hedge around any of these numbers, which we have committed.\nShalabh Saxena: Let me just supplement because I've been hearing this commentary. This is, we are not selling\nconsumer durables or commodities. This is finance, where you have to get the money back. It is\nvery critical that, you deliver quality. And hence, over a period, you will have those ups and\ndowns for sure. But as long as you are in the guidance of the sub 2%, during this conversation\nitself.\nI have quoted a number of 1.5%, 1.6% twice over. As long as you are in that range, you will see\nthis numbers going up, down marginally. But you have to operate in that range to deliver the\nnumber that we are talking of. As long as you are there, you should not be worried about it.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nWhile right now, the graph to the GNPAs and the SMAs, all of that is sliding down. You could\nsee in the future, some bit of some bps going up, it could further go down from here as well. All\nI'm trying to mention is that you will have those seasonal plays. You will those few issues here\nand there. But what is very critical is the larger point that you have to operate in that range,\nwhich is deliver quantity along with quality. As long as the framework, if you are able to deliver\nin that framework, which you came out with under the Vision '25, we should be fine. And that\nis what, we are focused on.\nRohan: Okay. The second question was, if you could just kind of highlight, which of the states are now\ndominating your disbursement for the quarter and also the portion of your overall loan book?\nShalabh Saxena: I think in the -- because this was a suggestion in the last call, somebody had I'm forgetting the\nname, Slide number 19 in the annexure, we have given the state wise split. So we have the --\nand it's a good question. I will extend with your permission, the question and I'll give you the\nanswer also. There are two states, 16% is Madhya Pradesh, 15% is Orissa.\nAnd then there are 11% and 10%. By end of FY '25, if all goes well, all the big ones should be\nanywhere in the range of 10% to 11%, at best 12%. That is our comfort zone. So comfort zone\nis 12% max contribution from a state. The plan is such, and that is why the focus on the seven\nstates because we don't have great market share. And those are good potential places.\nSo this year, in those seven states, we will end of the total AUM, we will have about 23% coming\nfrom these seven states. End of next year, which is FY '25, that will go about 44%-45%. So that\nis the overall larger picture. And this solves the concentration problem also, which is the end\nobjective, or which is the objective that we are running at and we will work our way to ensure\nthat is the number that we will be end of FY '25. We have already started seeing the results over\nthe past quarter, three quarters, in fact and this trend will continue.\nRohan: Yes. Thank you.\nModerator: Thank you. We take the next question from the line of Sagar Rungta from Anand Rathi. Please\ngo ahead.\nSagar Rungta: Good evening, Mr. Shalabh and Ashish. Just one question from my side. If you could give a\nbroad colour on the FOIR levels of your new customer acquisition from the focus states and a\ncap at which Spandana as an organization looks at?\nShalabh Saxena: FOIR levels. Did I hear you right?\nSagar Rungta: Yes.\nShalabh Saxena: So look, we work within the norms and whatever is allowable is what we will do because that\nyou can't really fight the -- there's no point. There is a clearly defined sensible and the right\napproach, which has been prescribed, and we will follow that. That's number one. What is in our\ncontrol are the levels of lending. And hence, we track the indebtedness level at a borrower and\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJuly 24, 2023\nnot the ticket size because in our view, booking a ticket size does not give the full picture. The\nindebtedness level at a customer has to be looked at, and that is what we track.\nAnd over a period of time, over the ticket sizes also as more and more we keep on and I think in\nthe beginning of the commentary, I have said that the seven states that we have started our\nbusiness, we operate on a lower ticket size. In fact, 80,000 on a cycle four customer is the max\nthat we give in Spandana, which will probably be one of the -- it is a lower number than the\nindustry.\nThe industry has already hit 1,00,000, 1,25,000 all kinds of numbers are floating around. We are\nnot ticket size players. We are not a higher ticket size player. You might lose out the customer.\nSo be it. Our experience is that a good relationship and a transparent conduct drives the\nrelationship, not a ticket size for that matter. And that is what, we'll keep on pursuing.\nSo the larger question is, what is the compromise you are doing, when you operate in this\nsegment? We focus on the JLG. In fact, as I said the last time, we've been making this point. All\nthe new branches that we are opening anywhere now, are weekly models. So that is our belief\nin the system and the JLG is something that we strongly believe in. So we will continue to pursue\nthis. Ticket size is something that, never gets us excited. And for whatever reason, we kind of\ntend to shy away from that.\nSagar Rungta: Yes, sir, my question was more in terms of a broad idea on the FOIR levels of the customers?\nShalabh Saxena: So we can, I don't have the data handy, but it's a very black-and-white. If you're in stock, what\nare you allowed? You are allowed INR1,50,000 at a household level of the installment. That's\nthe max. This is a practice that I have heard that people have started increasing the tenure of the\nloans to kind of fit into this. Once again, not a great fan of this idea.\nThis is an unsecured lending, unsecured lending 24 months is the max that one should look at.\nAnd at this point in time, we will hold on to this these. The FOIR level, so if they qualify, we\nget you the numbers if you want. What you want to know is, how much is the headway within\nthat customer's household. correct? That's the question in a different way, right?\nSagar Rungta: Yes, sir.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So we don't have the numbers right now. We'll find it out.\nSagar Rungta: No worry, sir. I'll take off-line, sir. Thank you, sir.\nModerator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraint, we take the last question. This was\nthe last question. I would now like to hand the conference back to the management for their\nclosing remarks. Over to you all.\n",

Good evening to all of you, thank you for joining the call and investing\nthe time in understanding the journey of Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited. Friends, it\nhas been over six quarters that the current management has been handling the business under\nSpandana 2.0. Over the past quarters, we have collectively focused on the following priorities.\nNumber one, people, which is reinforcing the middle and senior management team with\nprofessionals that was number one. Number two or the second priority was strengthening\ngovernance risk and control with added focus on refining the processes. Number three focus\non customer acquisition led business growth. Number four technology scale up. Number five\ncustomer led initiatives with emphasis on product services and meeting their lifecycle needs.\nThese are the priorities, if I may just refresh, which were the ones which we had set out when\nwe had come out with the vision 2025 document on the 11th of July 2022. While the agenda\nis still work in progress, suffice to add we have made significant progress on each of the\nitems. At this stage we can say with reasonable surety that the company is on course to\nbecoming a process driven and stable enterprise with professionals manning their respective\ndomains. We are taking all the steps to ensure the company becomes future ready to capitalize\nthe opportunity that exists in the environment. Before I go on to the results, let me also\narticulate the broad changes we have made over the past to make the company future ready.\nThe first is people practices and communication. Number two cultural changes, number three\nprocess improvements, number four a completely data-driven approach through the\norganization and number five distribution initiatives. They are in no particular order each of\nthem are as important as the others. On the five topics that I just covered, let me just elaborate.\nWe have rolled out employee benefits like mediclaim, life insurance, formalizing\nperformance management system, institutionalizing long service awards, greater focus on\ntraining and development of our team members. organizing town hall every quarter, which is\na two-way communication with employees to communicate the progress of the company and\nvice versa taking feedback. We believe that in a large distribution as us, it is important that\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nwe over communicate with our teams so that the thought process and feedback both are well\ncascaded and received. Specific to distribution, we have taken the following steps which are\nvery important in our considered opinion for defining the future of the company. The first\none is customer acquisition led growth, second is moving to weekly repayment model from\nthe current monthly, number three geographical concentration mitigation approach, which is\nhow we had come across and we had come out with seven focus states mandate. Number\nfour branch expansion. On the branch expansion, I would just want to detail during the course\nof this calendar year, we have operationalized 292 branches already. There are 110 branches\nwhich are ready to be operationalized over the next three months thus taking our tally to over\n1500 branches. This completes our plan of having 1500 branches by FY2025 as articulated\nin the vision 2025. So, while our vision 2025 document had a plan of 1500 branches end of\nFY2025, but looking at the way we were progressing, we thought that it is important that with\nthe momentum we open the branches as well so that we have a clear 12 months for all the\n1500 branches to kind of deliver over the next year which is FY2025. So, while we are ahead\nof our plan, which obviously impacts cost in the shorter run. However, in the long run we\nwill have a significant upside to our distribution and profitability plans. We will now have\nthe full 12 months of next financial year to deliver growth from the branches. Point number\nfive, focus on JLG. Joint liability group is something that we as a team believe in and we are\npassionate about it. So, the philosophy of five center meetings, which is Monday to Friday\nwith five groups in a center and five members in a group is something that we are progressing\non. Another focus area is timely conduct of center meetings and focus on attendance. Number\nthree is focus on operational efficiency, like distances travelled by loan officer, geo tagging\nof customer homes etc. While I have listed the focus areas, I have to admit that we are not\nthere yet. We will take about 3-4 quarters to reach the desired levels but as they say this is a\ncontinuous work in progress. If I were to kind of give you a gist our belief and philosophy\nremains number one, acquire more, which is the customer acquisition bit. Number two, lend\nshorter tenures, which is 12 months and 18 months, is what we have introduced and\naccordingly we see a significant movement in those portfolios, number three is muted ticket\nsizes. Personally, as a management, we feel that it is always good to be short on ticket sizes,\nnot really aggressive on ticket sizes and which is what we are progressing on and number\nfour weekly repayment. We will continue to pursue this path. If you remember, we had said\nthat all the new branches that we are going to open will be weekly branches and we have a\nplan from now until exit 2025 of converting the current monthly branches into weekly. We\ncan safely say that end of FY2025 about 80% Spandana should be weekly. Coming to\ncollection model or project Parivartan and here I would want to spend some time on project\nParivartan. So just to give you a background in our company the first 10 calendar days of the\nmonth were reserved for collections and the balance 20 days was for disbursement, customer\nacquisition, etc. This was the model of the company, which we have tried to rework under\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nthe project Parivartan, and I will just get into the details. So fundamentally we believe that\nunder microfinance we should be doing all the three things which is acquire customers,\ndisburse to customers, and collect from the customers, all the three things at the same time.\nSo, while we had a model, we thought that this was the time which was Q2 because we could\nnot have done it around Q3 or Q4. So Q2 was the time when we said we will modify the\ndistribution model. This was to ensure that the distribution model remains scalable, and we\ncontinue to do all the three things as I said on all the days. So, we changed the model in Q2\nin 700 branches, which covered about 1.5 million customers. So, what did we change? First\nof all, we moved the customer repayments from the dates that is 1st to 10th from the date to\nweekdays which is Monday to Friday of the month with Saturday and Sunday being a no\ncustomer operations day. This led to a change in repayment days for almost all the customers\nwhich were there in these 700 branches, which was the 15 lakh customers that I just spoke\nabout. The reason why we did it was while I said we had to do all the three things, acquire\ncustomers, disburse to the customers, and collect from the customers on all the days. This\nalso gives our employees two Saturdays to do training administrative work. So, we spent\nsignificant time in communicating the changes to the customers obviously with a base of\nabout 1.5 million and initiatives of this mega scale, there are bound to be disruptions. There\nwere many instances when our team members reached to conduct center meetings, but the\ncustomers probably missed coming because their schedule was slightly different from what\nwe would have articulated. On the contrary, there were many instances where our team\nmembers because of the change reached at a different time of the meetings, thus missing the\ncustomers who came and went away. The above also has led apart from a bit of a disruption\nin the field it has also led to an increase in the flows in the buckets as you would have noticed\nin the presentation. However, we are very confident that this is temporary and in the next\nthree to four months we will stabilize and even out the variances. Not really ideal, however,\nwe did anticipate this. We had to bite this bullet, had to go through the temporary\ninconvenience and disruption for a better tomorrow and we walked the path. We are seeing\nnormalization and by next quarter we should have regularized this.\nNow to go to the highlights of the quarter. New customer acquisition. The results are already\nuploaded on the BSE and NSE, but however, I will just quickly go through the results. New\naddition during the quarter was 3.5 lakhs a Y-O-Y growth of about 183%, last year same\nquarter it was 1.2 lakhs. So, from 1.2 lakh it has moved to 3.5 lakh. Last quarter we were at\n2.6 lakh, so there is quarter on quarter growth of 34% so Y-O-Y growth 183%, quarter on\nquarter growth of 34%. We have acquired 6.1 lakh customers in the first half of the year, well\non course to cross 3 million customer base by end of the year.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nWe are currently at 2.7 million customers, a growth of 24% Y-O-Y and a 12% growth over\nthe previous quarter. The AUM end of the quarter is 9,784 Crores or 69% growth Y-O-Y and\n11% growth quarter on quarter. Geographical concentration risk in MFI is the biggest risk.\nBeginning of last year when we presented the vision 2025 paper, we had identified seven\nfocus states where we would grow our business to mitigate this. Those states now contribute\n22% to the AUM. By end of the year, we should be 26% and end of next year this will be in\nthe range of 41 to 44%. End of next year, our endeavor is to ensure no state is more than 12%\nof the total AUM. This is a big step that we are taking. Currently our biggest states are in the\nrange of about 15, 15.2, 15.3. However, we have another six quarters to really moderate these\nand get the big ones down to 12%. We are comfortable with a single state contribution of\nabout 12% or below. On the disbursement, disbursement for the quarter was 2,513 Crores.\nThis was a Y-O-Y growth of 81% and a quarter-on-quarter growth of 51%. Quarter one we\ndisbursed 1,664 Crores. On the asset quality, the current book is at 96.7%. This has seen a bit\nof a dip because of the project Parivartan that I mentioned. The GNPA however, has gone\ndown. It has fallen 23 bps to 1.4% and this is quarter on quarter, if I look at a Y-O-Y it was\n7.37% as on 30th September of last year. NNPA again has seen a reduction of 7 bps over\nprevious quarter, so we are at 0.42%. So, without confusing on too many numbers, the GNPA\nin the current quarter is 1.4% and NNPA is 0.42%. We continue to maintain a PCR of 70.26%.\nOur CRAR is at a healthy 36.6%, indicating a good balance sheet position. Collection\nefficiency I have already mentioned. Net collection efficiency was 97.7% versus 98.1% so\nthat is where minus 0.4% for the reasons that I mentioned, project Parivartan. The gross\ncollection efficiency however, which is collection with the lag is at 100.3%. On the\nborrowings bit, it was a good quarter for us. We mobilized 3,191 Crores in quarter versus\n1,080 Crores last year same quarter, growth of about 195%. Happy to inform all that we added\nthree big lenders in the quarter, State Bank of India, NABARD and SIDBI. You would have\nseen the presentation our cash position also was very healthy. End of quarter the balance sheet\nhad a cash of 1850 Crores. Coming to financial performance, the total income was 640 Crores,\nwhich was a growth of 106% Y-O-Y and 21% quarter on quarter. Net income was 412 Crores,\na growth of 89%. The yield has gone up quarter on quarter and while the same quarter last\nyear was 19.5% but even on a quarter on quarter it has gone up by about 0.45%. So, it was\nabout 24% last quarter. We are at 24.5% this quarter. The NIMS of the portfolio is 14.1% an\nimprovement of 113 bps over previous year. However, down 0.11% over previous quarter.\nThis has been because of increase in the leverage which has gone up from 1.98x in previous\nquarter to 2.31 in Q2. So, we will see some compression as we continue to increase our\nleverage. We have made this position earlier that south of 4x is something that we would be\ncomfortable with. So anywhere 3.5 to 4 and once we hit that we start looking for growth\ncapital. As of now that distance is some bit away. On the PPOP we reported 258 Crores a Y-\nO-Y growth of 134% and a 36% increase over Q1. Consequently, our profit after tax this\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nquarter has been 125 Crores, which is a growth of 127% Y-O-Y and a 5% growth quarter on\nquarter. During the quarter, we also received a rating upgrade from ICRA. Our credit rating\nwas upgraded to A stable from A minus positive earlier. So now the three rating agencies, all\nof them are at par.\nTo summarize, we will end the year at about 12,000 Crores of AUM. We ended the last\nquarter at 9782, so we will end the year at 12,000 Crores this year which is exactly what we\nhave been saying over the past few quarters. This will entail disbursing about 3000 Crores\nand 3500 Crores in Q3 and Q4, which we are confident of meeting. All distribution led\ninitiatives will be completed by end of Q3 beginning of Q4. These are predominantly opening\nof new branches and entailing the cost of opening those branches and manpower because it\ntakes about 60 days to operationalize a branch. We did this so that we could prepare for a\nclean 12 months of growth next year. So, the next few months will all be about stabilizing.\nNext year, which is FY2025 will be all about focusing on growth and most importantly\nfocusing on efficiencies and productivity. We have mentioned the vision 2025 and the\nreference to vision 2025 which was essentially a three-year plan which we had come out on\nthe 11th of July 2022 giving details of where do we want to take the company over the next\nthree years which is until FY2025. Happy to inform all of you that we started working on the\nvision 2028 plan because when we came out with the vision 2025, it was a three-year plan.\nWe are already midway. We have initiated the planning exercise for the subsequent three\nyears. We should be able to share the plan by the end of the year. Suffice to add we are usually\noptimistic of what the future holds for Spandana and the same should find its way in the plan.\nI thank all the stakeholders of Spandana, the board, our lenders and our colleagues in\nSpandana who pooled in their energies during the year. A special note of thanks to all the\nbranch staff, our loan officers, branch managers, and the entire field staff who are slogging\nhard to deliver the results. Thank you to all of you who are on the call. You have been a\nconstant source of encouragement by giving us positive advice, feedback and of course\nsupport during the year. We look forward to receiving similar encouragement in the future.\nWe have the entire management team with us and are ready to take questions. Thank you\nvery much.\nModerator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question\nis from the line of Shreepal Doshi from Equirus. Please go ahead.\nShreepal Doshi: Hello Sir, good evening and thank you for giving me the opportunity. Congratulations to you\nand the entire team for the good quarter. So, my first question was pertaining to the customer\naddition, so we had guided for almost 1 million customer addition during this year, and we\nhave already added 0.61 million customers and second half being a stronger half do you\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nbelieve we will be able to surpass that guidance and do much better customer acquisition\nwhich will be lead to further better loan growth.\nShalabh Saxena: We have done about 6.1 lakh in the first two quarters. So theoretically what you are saying is\nright. But however, want you to also keep in context is the 3000 to 3500 Crores that we will\ndo. Within that yes, the one could become 1.1 maybe could be about 1.15 lakh as well beyond\nthat there is a certain mix that we have in mind which we are kind of executed. Plus, we have\na lot of unfinished work on the distribution side that we had. So yes, there is opportunity in\nthe market and what we also observed is that post the release of the pent-up demand about\nsix to eight quarters back now the demand is pretty stable so we will measure and calibrate\nour steps Shreepal. Our focus on customer acquisition will remain 1.1 million against 1\nmillion guidance is possibly a doable thing, but broadly speaking we will remain within\n12,000 Crores kind of a number and utilize that time to kind of do other distribution initiatives\nthat we have on our agenda.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it. Sir second question was pertaining to the credit cost, so during this quarter we have\nseen that increase to almost 3.9% on an annualized basis. So, could you please throw some\nlight on that, and will this run rate lead to any change in our guidance of 2% for the year?\nAshish Damani: Hi Shreepal. This is Ashish this side. So if you look at the credit cost, we have given the\nbreakup what is coming from the BAU is about 1.2%. We do have some like dated\nprovisioning that we have done which is another 2.6%. In my mind the other items, the\nARC and some correction that we had to do on the assignment portfolio that we have is\nlargely addressed. We may have some more flows, but that will be calibrated within a\nperiod of time. What is important is to look at what is coming from the BAU or the book\nthat we have created in the recent past or the book which is going to continue in the balance\nsheet and that is stacking at about 1.4% right now and I think this can be improved from\nhere on.\nShreepal Doshi: As Sir highlighted that the collection efficiency was affected because of the project\nParivartan right. So, can that also lead to an increase in credit cost requirement for the year\nor increasing flows from here on?\nAshish Damani: So, whatever is currently built in does have some bit of impact because of Parivartan as\nwell. So, it is already taken into account. Going forward we believe that things will improve\nfrom here on. It is the initial hiccup which has added to the flows and that is reflecting in\nprimarily 1 to 30 and 30 to 60 bucket. But I think further flows into 90 plus whatever the\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nnatural flow will be there that would definitely happen. But the ones which are primarily\nbecause of administrative issues should correct in the coming few months.\nShalabh Saxena: So Shreepal let me also add, will there be an impact, there is already an impact. Will it\nflow, yes little bit will flow for sure. There is no doubt about it. However, will it kind of\nsignificantly impact the guidance, no chance. We had said that it will be sub of 2% we are\nbelow that where this is a pain of one quarter which we had to take because the model in\nour wisdom had to be made scalable which we kind of walked that path. Once we are there,\nwe kind of set right about 15 lakh customers and about 700 branches rest obviously the 300\nbranches are functioning and this year we have no plan to do anything on those 300\nbranches. The new branches are either way weekly so that part is sorted already. So, all\nthese initiatives in our wisdom have to be taken if you really want to take Spandana to\n17,000 Crores and a stable and a robust model is what we have kind of planned for and this\nis a step in that direction. Yes, we will have an impact probably in this quarter also, but this\nis all temporary because these are customers who are with us. It is just that entire disruption\nin terms of our schedule and their schedule has kind of not really aligned well and with 1.5\nmillion base these things are anticipated. So hence we chose July and August month to\nkind of execute this so that we can cover up by the month of March of this year.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it Sir. Thank you so much for the detailed answer. Sir one last question was pertaining\nto the collection efficiency again. Sir have we seen any impact in collection efficiency in\nBihar or UP sort of states where in there was derailment in collection efficiency because\nof rainfall or monsoon.\nAshish Damani: So, we did our analysis. Our chief risk officer, he did a detailed analysis on both the drought\nwhich is the short rainfall and wherever there was excess rainfall, the impact of both which\nis deficient as well as wherever there was higher, the total portfolio impact was about 2.5\nor 3% of our entire books. So, per say and this exercise we did just about I think about four\nweeks or three weeks back when this thing was very right. So immediately Bihar we have\na book, which is reasonably manageable. We are doing a very, very calibrated approach in\neach of these growth states and we are fine. We have not seen any drop or any stress if that\nis the question.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it Sir. So, the collection efficiency would broadly be like what I mean 94-95% for that\n2.5% portfolio or would it be even lower than that.\nAshish Damani: So specific question to Bihar, the collection efficiency actually is better than the national\naverage.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nShreepal Doshi: Got it Sir.\nShalabh Saxena: Because this is a very standard question which gets asked. We have not experienced any\nspecific stress in any of the states that we are talking about. Wherever there are issues, they\nare more internal than a market or environment. So hence that is a matter of solace for us\nand everybody in the industry. But yes of course, we would be very careful when we lend\nand as I said lend short, lend muted.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it Sir. Thank you so much for answering all my questions. Good luck for the next\nquarter.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Renish Bhuva from ICICI Securities.\nPlease go ahead.\nRenish Bhuva: Yes, hi Sir. Congrats on a good set of numbers. Sir just two questions from my side, one\non the customer acquisition side, so in this quarter, the new customer addition is actually\nat par with the industry leader in fact it is higher than that. So just wanted to understand\nwhat percentage of this customer are let us say unique to us and maybe if you can just\nfurther share whether we will be what second, third lender or will we be let us say first or\nsecond lender?\nShalabh Saxena: So, Renish good evening. I will give you the stats. It is not just specific to 3.5. I am just\ngiving you a flavor because it becomes a more slightly wider answer, 33 to 34% of our\ncustomer base, it was about 36% last quarter. We are 34% is a single lender relation with\nSpandana and another 33% is 1 + 1 which is apart from Spandana there is one more. So,\nthis takes it to about 68-69. We have about 19% with the 1 + 2 and then the others are, once\nthey take a loan from us, then they go and kind of borrow from somewhere else, but what\nwe have also been observing Renish, is doing a lot of analytics in terms of is there a\ncorrelation of either a ticket size or a number of lenders to the repayment behavior of the\ncustomers. Until now we have not really seen any that is number one. Number two our\nfocus will be on moving into geographies where we increase the single lender relationship\nbecause single lender relationship also is a factor of our existing customer base and how\nmuch they want. So given the fact that we have normalized our operations, you will see a\nlot of these things, the 33-34% touching the 38, 39, 40%. If you go back to my Q1 earnings\ncall we had said that our desire is that single lender and a one plus one should be a 38, 39\nequivalent, so about 78, 79 should be one or 1 + 1. So that is the distance that we have to\ntravel, and we are walking that path that in our wisdom weekly repayment helps us in that\nplus now out in the market from a customer point of view Spandana is acknowledged as a\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nstable lender which when they need there is a credit demand, and this is a credit they need\na periodic dose of capital for running their regular businesses. Once they have that\nconfidence, you will see this number increasing so that is how we are approaching the\nbusiness.\nRenish Bhuva: Got it and just to follow up on that, so let us say the customer pool, wherein the lender\nrelationship is 1 + 2 and above, what could be the industry level outstanding for borrower.\nShalabh Saxena: Renish see at a point in time hamara philosophy kya hai, hamara philosophy hai 2 Tak. I\nmean it does not really ring a bell with us. So, we will continue to acquire more and more\ncustomer which is the earlier question Shreepal asked, so we will continue to focus on that\nand hence our experience is on a customer ticket size, we are very well entrenched, and we\nare very well in our capacity to ensure that we are able to hold on to our customer. I mean\nas in right now we have about 2.7 million so that is what it is. What is very critical is the\nshare of wallet increases and to the extent possible if required even if a customer has a\nvintage of seven years or eight years, we are still stuck at our maximum ticket size of\n80,000 not more. So, we are continuing to follow that philosophy and I think we will\nprogress.\nAshish Damani: I will just add. Hi Renish, our exposure at a customer level is 36,800 thereabouts. If you\nlook at the industry average should be hovering around, you know 40 to 43,000. So, if you\nadd my borrower, my loan plus another loan we are talking about 80,000 or somewhere\nthere if, unless somebody has given loan which are like three years and all then this number\ncan increase but otherwise this should be hovering around, so given that we do not have\nthree years loan. We have all two year at best. I think our kind of customer should be in\nthat range of 70 to 80,000 maximum exposure in that one plus one that you talked about.\nShalabh Saxena: So, you asked a very important question Renish, and I am just adding a nuance to it. What\nwe track is not the ticket size, what we track is the indebtedness level, our indebtedness\nlevel today is about 36,000 and this I can say with reasonable surety either will remain\nstatic at this number or will keep going down which is exactly the opposite of how the\nindustry is moving but we are very comfortable with this position. Our philosophy remains\nand this is what we believe in. You will never lose a customer either on interest rate or\nticket size. You will lose a customer on your conduct, the way you kind of approach the\ncustomer, the way you deal with them. If you are transparent, if you are honest, if you\nmaintain a cordial relationship with them and ensure that the credit supply is taken care of,\ntheir credit demand is taken care of, you are there.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nRenish Bhuva: Got it. Sorry to follow up on that. So let me put it this way. What is our credit filters?\nWherein if the system level indebtedness of the customer goes let us say about 1 lakh or\nabove 80,000 will not lend. We have that kind of credit filters in our process or no.\nShalabh Saxena: It works in the reverse. Given the FOIR and the 1.5 lakh that is automatic ceiling. My\nrejection at this point in time is 45% and the only way to reduce that rejection is to increase\nthe tenor from 24 to 36 or 48 which either way we do not have. So as a policy we are\nrejecting the higher number for the reasons that I said because we think this is the right\nway to do.\nAshish Damani: So, I will just bring down that. The way you can disburse a loan is maximum tenure can be\nonly two years and within that FOIR eligibility. So, either your amount will go down or\nthe loan will be rejected altogether that is how it works.\nRenish Bhuva: Got it and just last question from my side on the credit cost. So, Ashish you did mention\nthat this 58 Crores in this quarter is related to the past book but let us say in next two\nquarters what kind of impairment we still expect from the past book, or this is the last leg,\nand we are completely done with the past impairment.\nAshish Damani: So, there are two pieces to this, Renish. One is ARC book that we have on the balance\nsheet. The total outstanding on the balance sheet is about 164 Crores. We carry a provision\nof 34 Crores which emanates from the ratings that are given by the trustee and the rating\nagency, so the provision is driven by that. We are confident that we will be able to collect\nmost of the ARC pool. So further provisioning may not be required in my mind, but if it\nhappens it should happen gradually over a period of time that is part one. The other part is\nmore about the assignment transaction, and it is a calibration that we have been doing\naround this. What we have on the balance sheet presently uncovered or let us say what we\nhave already paid as advance to the banks and needs to be addressed in the balance sheet\nis about 16.6-17 Crores roughly, let us say. Having said that we are in a business where we\nneed to keep taking the interest from the banks perspective as well and keep having a\nreserve around this so one can expect let us say I am just estimating a 40 to 50 Crores kind\nof a number over a period of time, not necessarily immediate or whatever, but I am just\ndoing a future gazing here in a way that is the number I have in mind and we will be\ncomfortable with that if at all that happens.\nRenish Bhuva: Got it. Again, I mean if we have only 17-18 Crores which is there on the balance sheet then\nwhy we are saying 40-50 Crores.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nShalabh Saxena: Renish this is future. This could happen is what Ashish is saying. While our efforts on the\nfield continues, we are just defining the scope and the limit to what the discussion that we\nare having at this point in time. It is not that this will happen next quarter or the next three\nquarters or four quarters. We are saying that is the total quantum of issue to be addressed\nwhile our efforts on the field continue that is the max that we are talking about. That is the\npoint Ashish was mentioning.\nRenish Bhuva: Got it. Okay that is it from my side Sir. Best of luck Sir.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sagar Shah from Piper Serica. Please go\nahead.\nSagar Shah: Good evening, Sir and first of all congratulations for such a healthy set of numbers. I just\nhad one question actually basically that was related on your slide #8 actually. So, my query\nwas that when I am seeing from 1 to 30-day bucket and from 31 to 60-day bucket, I am\nseeing a little bit deterioration in the asset quality, the 1 to 30 day bucket has gone up for\nthe first time from 0.55 to 0.85 and 31 to 60 has gone from 0.42 to 0.60 and it has increased\nfor the first time in the last six odd quarters actually. So, my query was that are we actually\nstarted seeing some stress which we have not seen actually for the last several quarters in\nthis microfinance space. And if yes, then can you give some colour on that please?\nAshish Damani: Hi good evening, Sagar thanks for the question. I think this is partly covered in the opening\nremarks made by Shalabh. I will try to explain this in a little more detail. The movement\nthat you see in the SMA buckets primarily can be attributed to the Parivartan project that\nthe company has taken up. We have moved almost about 700 branches in last quarter from\na monthly kind of an exercise where we used to collect between 1st and 10th of the month\nto a weekly kind of a setup where we are asking customers to make the payments in the\nfirst week of the particular month which is Monday to Friday. So in this there is\nadministrative issue where the customers are still not aligned to the new thought process\nand that is what is creating a little bit of slipovers. So if you see our overall collection on\nthe gross basis is still 100.3% which means people are paying with some lag and there are\nsome miss outs that have happened which will catch up as we progress and I think what\nwe believe is in another three to four months you could see this again normalizing and\ngoing back to levels where we were in the past.\nShalabh Saxena: So, Sagar, I covered this at a length in my opening remark, but broadly, our company used\nto follow a collection cycle of first to 10 which was a date, and the balance 20 days was for\na disbursement and member acquisition. What we have done is we thought the right thing\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nto do was to do all the three things which is collect, disburse, and acquire new customers\nevery single day of the 20-21 days that you work. So, we moved in 700 branches covering\n1.5 million customers from the date to a day which is instead of 1st to 10th now we are\nseeing Monday to Friday. We came out with a schedule to the customer saying that your\ninstallment is not on e.g. 8th but it is on Wednesday or Thursday or Friday and this reaching\nto 15 lakh customers for a scale of this obviously there was to be a disruption that is why\nwe chose this quarter. We were fully aware of the risk.\nSagar Shah: Okay sure Sir and my last question Sir was related to credit cost. As you already highlighted\nthere was a one off in the quarter related to restructuring. So that is how our credit cost was\nlittle high at 90 Crores. So can you give a guidance of our credit cost for FY2024 and for\nFY2025 also.\nShalabh Saxena: If you look at our slide, our credit cost is 1.4% only, the balance that is towards the FRs\nand some assignment transaction that we have done. I do not want to really take up the\ntime of the others, but you can separately reach out to us and then we will get in touch with\nyou.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from Rajiv Mehta from YES Securities. Please go ahead.\nRajiv Mehta: Hi Shalabh and Ashish. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to ask questions and\ncongrats on demonstrating significant scale up of the franchise. So, first question is on the\nportfolio yield. So, portfolio yield has improved from 24% to 24.5% but the interest income\nhas grown exactly in line with loan portfolio that is by 10-11% so does it imply that a good\npart of the growth that keeps on the quarter was slightly back ended, and a true reflection\nof the higher yield will come in Q3?\nAshish Damani: Hi Rajiv, good evening. So, I think the entire growth is in line with the portfolio growth\nand the reflection of the yield is nothing but whatever the top line growth has been. What\nhowever happens is we have done two DA transactions which will move some of the\nincome related to the quarter as well into the other line item apart from the preponing of\nincome because of the DA transaction which is almost about 42 Crores which has gone\ninto the other income line item that gives you some aberration. In terms of as far as portfolio\nyield is concerned, I think we are very much there may be another 10 to 20 bps is what you\ncan see.\nShalabh Saxena: So, the history is Rajiv, post the March regulations we increased the interest rate the first\ntime around in June of 2022, so we had taken up our IRR from 21.97 to 24% in October,\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nwhich is 12th of October 2022, which was last year, we took it up to 25. So, for the past\nfour quarters we have been stable at the same interest rate. So, the yield on account of the\ndelta on interest rate has I think kind of come one full year on a portfolio point of view, so\nnow what you will see is not what the delta on account of increase in the rate, but more on\naccount of the denominator increasing which will kind of progress as we move.\nAshish Damani: And just to cover the question in two numbers, 7% was the increase in the average AUM.\nThe increase in the top line, interest income has been around 10% so those are the numbers\nfor you Rajiv.\nRajiv Mehta: Shalabh you also said that customer level indebtedness will remain static or maybe even\nslightly come down. So, when you speak about indebtedness, you are talking about our\naverage outstanding to the customer borrower.\nShalabh Saxena: Correct.\nRajiv Mehta: So then does it not imply that customer retention or portfolio will not improve because\nnaturally as your processes, your things are becoming much and much better the customer\nstickiness and the customer attention should improve and the migration into subsequent\ncycles will left the overall blended outstanding per borrower but I agree that you will also\nadd new clients but can it not improve I am just asking.\nShalabh Saxena: So, what you are saying is right. However, for the next one year so there are two parts we\nare discussing, we are discussing numbers, we are discussing philosophy. From a\nphilosophy point of view, we will always be on the lower end of the ticket sizes, and which\nis what in the early part of the conversation we said that our maximum ticket you are\noperating at is 80,000 which is substantially lower than the industry. What you are saying\nis right. However, for the next year when we continue to pursue our customer acquisition\nled growth. By design we offer our customer a first cycle loan at 35,000 you will see that\nnumber being stabilized at 36,000 or thereabouts. One year hence when currently our\nproportion of new versus vintage customer is about 50:50. The day we start coming down\nto a 30% new and 70% existing that is when the 36 will start inching up and that will\neventually play out say about six quarters from now. But however, the 36 is unlikely to\nbecome a 46 or a 48. At best 36 will be 37, 38, 39 that is the range that we are comfortable\nin, sub 40,000 indebtedness even for an existing customer base is a number that we should\nbe comfortable with.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nRajiv Mehta: So, what is your thoughts about your tenure per officer or officer to assets ratio, it may be\nin the medium to longer term where can we reach from where we are.\nShalabh Saxena: So, we have done this benchmarking. We are at an enterprise level we are currently at 347\nto a loan officer, so we are at a AUM currently is 1.2 excluding trainees, and our loan\nofficers are handling 317 borrowers per loan officer. However, 317 Rajiv is a number and\nthis 317 is because we have added a lot of branches and loan officers etc. This will\nimmediately in the short term hit in the neighborhood of about 380 to 400 borrowers per\nloan officer which next year we are targeting of 440 to 450 number. On the AUM side, we\nare currently at a 1.2. We are targeting a 1.4 to 1.5 over the next three to four quarters. That\nis the number we are targeting. On the AUM side 1.4 to 1.5 is the number that I foresee\nstabilizing and on the borrower to loan officer, I think a number anywhere between 450 to\n480 is a number that we will be comfortable with. We in our best of times done a 600 also\nin our previous company but those days were different. So now anywhere 450 to 470 is a\ngood enough number with a 1.5 Crores of corresponding portfolio. Sorry for the long\nanswer.\nRajiv Mehta: Thanks for this. Just a couple of observations and then I would like to hear your comments.\nAnd this is my last question. We have seen some addition even in the monthly collection\nmodel branches. Second question is about the growth in loan officers on sequential basis\nhas just been 4%. So, I am asking this question in the context of significant number of\nbranches that we have added.\nShalabh Saxena: Okay understood. So, the monthly addition is because of the split branches because the\nbranches sometimes outgrow their capability. When a branch starts stocking a 20 Crores\nkind of a portfolio you have no option but to administratively split otherwise it becomes a\nslightly riskier branch from cash handling etc., perspective so all of this either will follow\nour model of transforming from a monthly to weekly. On the loan officer count I think\nRajiv, we have kind of reached where we wanted to maybe another 500-700 and we are\ndone for in terms of recruitment. Our branch addition and recruitment we kind of done\nwhatever we had to which was my point in the commentary when I said that we have taken\nthe cost. We have done all the investments in the distribution. Now it is all about,\nefficiencies and productivity.\nRajiv Mehta: Thank you so much and best of luck.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Abhijit Tibrewal from Motilal Oswal.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Good evening, everyone and congrats Shalabh and Ashish on a good quarter. So just two\nquestions, the first one is more of a data keeping question. Ashish if you could just tell us\nwhat is the DA outstanding as on September?\nAshish Damani: 732 Crores.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Alright thank you and the other thing is this time around you already shared I think around\n42 Crores coming from the DA transaction which you showed as value change. So is this\nunderstanding right that I mean all the upfronting or what we call as finite income, when\nyou undertake a DA transaction, you are booking it as that you do not show that.\nAshish Damani: That is right Abhijit. This will include the income that you would have booked in the\ninterest income between the date of cut off and the date of transaction as well.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. So essentially if you do a retransaction 45 days into the quarter, 45 days of interest\nincome gets booked as net gain on fair value changes.\nAshish Damani: It may be 45 days; it may be 25 days depending upon where did I pick up the portfolio\nfrom which date onwards that is the way to think.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Understood and this time around we have reported net gain 60 Crores, 42 is coming from\nthis DA transaction that you did and other 18 Crores is coming from?\nAshish Damani: So whatever cash that we have we park it into overnight funds with the mutual fund\ncompanies and the income interest come from there.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: So even the treasury income is classified in the net gain on share value changes. Got it.\nLast question I had is I mean while you have already articulated maybe the yields will go\nup by 10-20 basis points. So, two parts to this one is I mean on yields do you think there is\nsome regulatory risk not specifically to you but given how I mean other peers and the\ninterest rates at which they are lending do you think there is a regulatory risk of again some\nkind of a capping coming in and the other question is specifically on your cost of\nborrowings. I am seeing Ashish sequentially your incremental cost of borrowing has\nremained stable, very heartening to hear that you have added three big lenders during this\nquarter. SBI, NABARD, and SIDBI. So based on how discussions are progressing, I am\nhoping you will look to add more maybe PSU banks lending relationships going forward.\nSo how should the cost of borrowing kind of trend incrementally as well on portfolio basis\ngoing forward?\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nAshish Damani: I will answer the cost of borrowing and then I will hand it over to Shalabh on the industry\nview for how the interest rates are likely to move. In terms of cost of borrowings, yes as\nwe progress we should see more improvement in the marginal cost of borrowings for us\nbut if you overlook at the moment in terms of our cost of borrowing it has been between\nabout 130 bps between last year and this year and if I have to look at how the overall\ninterest rates on the repo side has moved, it is also like close to about 240-250 basis points.\nSo from that respect we have been doing well. Having said that I agree as the participation\nfrom the public sector banks improve and the mix changes, we should start seeing some\nbenefits on the borrowing side.\nShalabh Saxena: So, I will just supplement what Ashish said. What was left in our kitty over the public\nsector enterprises so by design this cost of the borrowing should go down that is our\nestimate, that is our guess, and it is a logical guess. Now to your first question on the interest\nrates and NIMS that are being charged. Now specific to us we are currently at 14.1% NIM.\nOur gearing is just 2.3. If our gearing goes to a 4 which it will eventually. One has to\noperate at a 3.5 to 4 X, the NIMS should settle anywhere at about 12, 12.5 add about 2%\nof credit cost and cost of operations so you are talking of roughly about 4, 4.5, 5%. So 4.5%\nis what we have said that we are currently at 7% but I think on AUM basis I think we\nshould settle anywhere on a long term basis at about 5, 5.5% and add another on the credit\ncost you will have 4.5 to 5% of ROA, so your question in terms of do we see any\nintervention, look this is a physical model which is a very expensive model. One has to\nphysically deploy a lot of people and for all practical purposes they have to be monitored\nwhich entails a lot of cost and hence 5, 5.5, 6% you need that amount to run the company.\nAt a point in time if there is a question from anywhere by regulator, there are others also\nwho asked this question. We have a perfectly valid reason that for unsecure micro finance\nlending 4, 4.5, 5% is a very much doable levels and limits that we are at. We also have to\nensure that as an industry we lend responsibly and when we say lend responsibly means\nthat the interest rates that we are talking about and industry if you see the big players, the\ntop ten players if I remember correctly contribute about 90% to the industry, most of them\nare in the median of the number which is a tolerable number. So, it is a number which is a\nlogical number to operate. We balance the interests of all the stakeholders. So, per say our\npersonal view is that if we continue to operate in this space, we should be fine. However,\nif there are questions, we will be happy to answer anybody outside.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. Thank you so much for the update. That is all from my side. All the very best to you\nShalabh, Ashish, and Spandana team.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sarvesh Gupta from Maximal Capital.\nPlease go ahead.\nSarvesh Gupta: Good evening, Sir and congratulations for a good set of numbers. Sir one question on the\nother loan product, so as part of our vision 2025, we had also said we will reach 3000\nCrores in other NMFI so what is the progress there till now given that we are six quarters\naway?\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you for asking this question, Sarvesh. We have opened ten branches in Rajasthan. I\nthink last time we had updated that we are going to expand in Rajasthan this is under our\nsubsidiary Criss Financials, so we opened ten branches. We have disbursed in the loan\nagainst property while we are still finding our feet, but we are progressing really well. We\nhave disbursed about 3.5 Crores and done about 105, 106 loans. On the nano MSME loans\nwe just opened this up, I think about last month of the quarter. Last quarter we have done\nabout 25 lakhs and 27 loans. We have 60 people already in the ten branches that we have\nspoken about. All of these are people from the industry, and I think I clarified this last time.\nThis is a separate market, separate branch, separate set of people and even in the head office\nat the chief business officer level, there are separate set of individuals kind of looking at it\nbecause this entails setting up a full-fledged credit department if you are looking into it.\nThis has nothing to do with micro finance so that is why we demarketed it and kept both\nthe models separate. Our plan is to take the number up to 50 branches by end of this year.\nI think we should do about roughly 75 Crores to 100 Crores by the end of the year. Next\nyear is when we scale up and we will scale pretty fast. We are just trying to even out all\nthe rough edges that we have in terms of system because there is a new system that we\nhave taken. This is not the microfinance system. So new system, new setup, new\nenvironment, new market, new set of people. All of this, we are just socializing ourselves\nand once done towards the later part of Q4, we kind of step up to deliver the plans that we\nhave communicated.\nSarvesh Gupta: Understood Sir and just one thing, one clarification on the credit cost part. So, if I\nunderstand this correctly this 58 odd Crores which has come up, so only 40 to 50 Crores\nwhich is from assignment transaction is the sort of the further flow into this sort of number\nwhich can happen as far as our pre 2021 book is concerned and nothing else is sort of under\nquestion as of now.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, so Sarvesh there were two pieces to it. One you got it right on the DA part. We do\nhave 128 Crores of unprovided ARC portfolio which is there, which we are very confident\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nof recovering that is there on the balance sheet. In case in future, we are not able to recover,\nwe will have to take some bit of cognizance of that.\nSarvesh Gupta: And remaining is the assignment which is 40 to 50 Crores over a period time.\nShalabh Saxena: That is right.\nSarvesh Gupta: So at least in one quarter you may not see this sort of a number going forward.\nShalabh Saxena: No.\nSarvesh Gupta: Understood and in the project Parivartan which might have some impact on your credit\ncost on this quarter in terms of flows so 1.3% that we have got is inclusive of that hence\nwe should expect this sort of a number going forward as well or do we think that the real\nsort of increase is going to come in the coming quarters from this?\nShalabh Saxena: So, we will see some flows in this quarter as well. Yes, the 1.4% is a part of this. However,\nwe are trying our best to kind of ensure that it remains within the original limits that we\nhave been delivering over the past few quarters. However, having said that our overall\nnumber that we have been very consistent in what we have been saying. We will be sub of\n2% that we are very confident of meeting.\nSarvesh Gupta: Understood Sir. Just one final question on the district concentration do we track that and is\nit in line with what we wanted to achieve? I understood the state wise guidance.\nShalabh Saxena: So, we do all of that, the branch, district, state, zone, all of that we do but the larger point\nis Sarvesh, and I would urge, and I would draw your attention to is our top three states are\n41-42%. They contribute 41-42% to our overall kitty. I do not know if you have that slide\nin front of you but if you go to the annexure slide 20 my top two states are 15 and rest all\nthe states are sub-11. If you go back to the commentary that I said we said that exit 25 none\nof the states will be more than 12% so which means two state Odisha and Madhya Pradesh\nhave to come down from the current 15 to 12% so this will come out one increase in\ndenominator and the second is obviously there are certain pockets of inefficiencies which\nwe kind of shut the tap on which is going to get us to that number. So, the concentration\nnorm and the corresponding mitigation is something that we are very, very clear in our\nhead that is what we are driving. I do not think we will take more than six quarters to kind\nof get to 12% across all states and the highest will be a 12% and the rest will be below.\nSarvesh Gupta: Sure, Sir. Congratulations again and wish you all the best.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nModerator: Thank you. The last question is from the line of Anand Mundra from Soar Wealth. Please\ngo ahead.\nAnand Mundra: Good evening, Sir. Congratulations on good set of results. I wanted to check on slide\nnumber 7 your current book percentage has come down so I could not understand this from\n97.1 to 96.7.\nAshish Damani: Anand this is same as what we have been discussing about so some of the payments are\ndelayed so they have been classified in the 1 to 30 bucket and that is why you see the\ncurrent number has gone down by 40 basis points.\nAnand Mundra: See what I understood from current and old number, one is current book, and one is a pre\nCOVID book that is how the percentage is.\nAshish Damani: Zero-day delinquency.\nAnand Mundra: Okay second Sir I wanted to check how many branches we have moved to weekly\ncollection now.\nShalabh Saxena: I will give you the December position. I think there is a slide also that we have put up here\nwhich is split into operational and not operational. We are already at 1502 branches of\nwhich about 95 odd branches are yet to start operations exit December which is two months\naway rough and ready about 370 to 380 branches should be weekly, when this all gets over,\nI think we should be at about 450. These are all organic branches which existing monthly\nfor whatever we are going to transform all of that will slowly start playing out in Q4 and\nthen Q1 from next year onwards.\nAnand Mundra: Sir this problem of increase in SMA2 and GNPA that will continue for another three or\nfour quarters from the time you are moving everything to weekly branches.\nShalabh Saxena: There is no link between the two. The new branches are weekly model, so there I see no\nchange now. We have moved to day instead of 1st to 10th we have moved Monday to Friday,\nwe are not doing it now in those branches, these branches which I said will take about three\nmonths, max four months and then we will be sorted. The other branches, 300 branches\nwhich are monthly are very big branches, so we are not touching them for now. Once let\nus do this and which is why I keep on making that statement that exit 2025 or end of\nFY2025 Spandana will be 80% weekly, not 100.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nAnand Mundra: Okay noted Sir, Sir one more thing, how much bad debt recovery happened in this quarter\nor six months?\nShalabh Saxena: H1 we have recovered 54 Crores. Last year write off recovery was about 39 last year, H1\nis 54 Crores, and we are targeting upwards of 100 Crores which is another 50 odd Crores\nin the balance.\nAnand Mundra: Okay and Sir with respect to collection efficiency since you have moved some branches to\nweekly, how this has been calculated now 97.7 percentage, so you are calculating\nseparately?\nShalabh Saxena: There is nothing to do with monthly or weekly. The definition for net collection efficiency\nis very simple. It was due on the day. Did you collect on the day or not? We have kept it\nso simple and did not complicate it, gross is what has come from lag.\nAnand Mundra: With respect to net collection, you are saying that you are taking date wise not month wise.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, it will happen on different days so at the end, let me make it simple for the September\nmonth, for September if there is a due from a customer, if it comes or not otherwise it will\ngo down.\nAnand Mundra: So, Sir you will see at the end of the month whether it is weekly or any day on the month\ncorrect.\nShalabh Saxena: We monitor every day but obviously from a representation point of view we have to draw\na line somewhere and present, so we follow that.\nAnand Mundra: Sir this gross collection and net collection the difference being the excess largely would be\nprepayment.\nShalabh Saxena: Say for example, if I had 100 due in the month of September, I collected 90. I am just\ntheoretically saying I collected 90, so 10 will be there. If the next month this I get 90 and\nthis last month 10 comes next month, then the next month net will be 90 and gross will be\n20.\nAnand Mundra: Understood Sir. I am done. Thanks a lot.\nModerator: Thank you very much. That was the last question in queue. I would now like to hand the\nconference back to the management team for closing comments.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nShalabh Saxena: So, thank you very much for, for being on the call. We are very thankful for giving us the\nsupport during the quarters. We will continue to deliver. As a management we will continue\nto work on the vision 2025 plan that we had articulated. As highlighted in my commentary\nearlier, we have started working on the vision 2025 to 2028 which we will be able to share\nwith you closer to the end of the year. So, thank you for all your support. Thank you very\nmuch.\nModerator: Thank you very much. On behalf of Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited that concludes\nthis conference. Thank you for joining us. Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect\nyour lines.\n****\n",

Good evening to all of you, thank you for joining the call and investing\nthe time in understanding the journey of Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited. Friends, it\nhas been over six quarters that the current management has been handling the business under\nSpandana 2.0. Over the past quarters, we have collectively focused on the following priorities.\nNumber one, people, which is reinforcing the middle and senior management team with\nprofessionals that was number one. Number two or the second priority was strengthening\ngovernance risk and control with added focus on refining the processes. Number three focus\non customer acquisition led business growth. Number four technology scale up. Number five\ncustomer led initiatives with emphasis on product services and meeting their lifecycle needs.\nThese are the priorities, if I may just refresh, which were the ones which we had set out when\nwe had come out with the vision 2025 document on the 11th of July 2022. While the agenda\nis still work in progress, suffice to add we have made significant progress on each of the\nitems. At this stage we can say with reasonable surety that the company is on course to\nbecoming a process driven and stable enterprise with professionals manning their respective\ndomains. We are taking all the steps to ensure the company becomes future ready to capitalize\nthe opportunity that exists in the environment. Before I go on to the results, let me also\narticulate the broad changes we have made over the past to make the company future ready.\nThe first is people practices and communication. Number two cultural changes, number three\nprocess improvements, number four a completely data-driven approach through the\norganization and number five distribution initiatives. They are in no particular order each of\nthem are as important as the others. On the five topics that I just covered, let me just elaborate.\nWe have rolled out employee benefits like mediclaim, life insurance, formalizing\nperformance management system, institutionalizing long service awards, greater focus on\ntraining and development of our team members. organizing town hall every quarter, which is\na two-way communication with employees to communicate the progress of the company and\nvice versa taking feedback. We believe that in a large distribution as us, it is important that\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nwe over communicate with our teams so that the thought process and feedback both are well\ncascaded and received. Specific to distribution, we have taken the following steps which are\nvery important in our considered opinion for defining the future of the company. The first\none is customer acquisition led growth, second is moving to weekly repayment model from\nthe current monthly, number three geographical concentration mitigation approach, which is\nhow we had come across and we had come out with seven focus states mandate. Number\nfour branch expansion. On the branch expansion, I would just want to detail during the course\nof this calendar year, we have operationalized 292 branches already. There are 110 branches\nwhich are ready to be operationalized over the next three months thus taking our tally to over\n1500 branches. This completes our plan of having 1500 branches by FY2025 as articulated\nin the vision 2025. So, while our vision 2025 document had a plan of 1500 branches end of\nFY2025, but looking at the way we were progressing, we thought that it is important that with\nthe momentum we open the branches as well so that we have a clear 12 months for all the\n1500 branches to kind of deliver over the next year which is FY2025. So, while we are ahead\nof our plan, which obviously impacts cost in the shorter run. However, in the long run we\nwill have a significant upside to our distribution and profitability plans. We will now have\nthe full 12 months of next financial year to deliver growth from the branches. Point number\nfive, focus on JLG. Joint liability group is something that we as a team believe in and we are\npassionate about it. So, the philosophy of five center meetings, which is Monday to Friday\nwith five groups in a center and five members in a group is something that we are progressing\non. Another focus area is timely conduct of center meetings and focus on attendance. Number\nthree is focus on operational efficiency, like distances travelled by loan officer, geo tagging\nof customer homes etc. While I have listed the focus areas, I have to admit that we are not\nthere yet. We will take about 3-4 quarters to reach the desired levels but as they say this is a\ncontinuous work in progress. If I were to kind of give you a gist our belief and philosophy\nremains number one, acquire more, which is the customer acquisition bit. Number two, lend\nshorter tenures, which is 12 months and 18 months, is what we have introduced and\naccordingly we see a significant movement in those portfolios, number three is muted ticket\nsizes. Personally, as a management, we feel that it is always good to be short on ticket sizes,\nnot really aggressive on ticket sizes and which is what we are progressing on and number\nfour weekly repayment. We will continue to pursue this path. If you remember, we had said\nthat all the new branches that we are going to open will be weekly branches and we have a\nplan from now until exit 2025 of converting the current monthly branches into weekly. We\ncan safely say that end of FY2025 about 80% Spandana should be weekly. Coming to\ncollection model or project Parivartan and here I would want to spend some time on project\nParivartan. So just to give you a background in our company the first 10 calendar days of the\nmonth were reserved for collections and the balance 20 days was for disbursement, customer\nacquisition, etc. This was the model of the company, which we have tried to rework under\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nthe project Parivartan, and I will just get into the details. So fundamentally we believe that\nunder microfinance we should be doing all the three things which is acquire customers,\ndisburse to customers, and collect from the customers, all the three things at the same time.\nSo, while we had a model, we thought that this was the time which was Q2 because we could\nnot have done it around Q3 or Q4. So Q2 was the time when we said we will modify the\ndistribution model. This was to ensure that the distribution model remains scalable, and we\ncontinue to do all the three things as I said on all the days. So, we changed the model in Q2\nin 700 branches, which covered about 1.5 million customers. So, what did we change? First\nof all, we moved the customer repayments from the dates that is 1st to 10th from the date to\nweekdays which is Monday to Friday of the month with Saturday and Sunday being a no\ncustomer operations day. This led to a change in repayment days for almost all the customers\nwhich were there in these 700 branches, which was the 15 lakh customers that I just spoke\nabout. The reason why we did it was while I said we had to do all the three things, acquire\ncustomers, disburse to the customers, and collect from the customers on all the days. This\nalso gives our employees two Saturdays to do training administrative work. So, we spent\nsignificant time in communicating the changes to the customers obviously with a base of\nabout 1.5 million and initiatives of this mega scale, there are bound to be disruptions. There\nwere many instances when our team members reached to conduct center meetings, but the\ncustomers probably missed coming because their schedule was slightly different from what\nwe would have articulated. On the contrary, there were many instances where our team\nmembers because of the change reached at a different time of the meetings, thus missing the\ncustomers who came and went away. The above also has led apart from a bit of a disruption\nin the field it has also led to an increase in the flows in the buckets as you would have noticed\nin the presentation. However, we are very confident that this is temporary and in the next\nthree to four months we will stabilize and even out the variances. Not really ideal, however,\nwe did anticipate this. We had to bite this bullet, had to go through the temporary\ninconvenience and disruption for a better tomorrow and we walked the path. We are seeing\nnormalization and by next quarter we should have regularized this.\nNow to go to the highlights of the quarter. New customer acquisition. The results are already\nuploaded on the BSE and NSE, but however, I will just quickly go through the results. New\naddition during the quarter was 3.5 lakhs a Y-O-Y growth of about 183%, last year same\nquarter it was 1.2 lakhs. So, from 1.2 lakh it has moved to 3.5 lakh. Last quarter we were at\n2.6 lakh, so there is quarter on quarter growth of 34% so Y-O-Y growth 183%, quarter on\nquarter growth of 34%. We have acquired 6.1 lakh customers in the first half of the year, well\non course to cross 3 million customer base by end of the year.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nWe are currently at 2.7 million customers, a growth of 24% Y-O-Y and a 12% growth over\nthe previous quarter. The AUM end of the quarter is 9,784 Crores or 69% growth Y-O-Y and\n11% growth quarter on quarter. Geographical concentration risk in MFI is the biggest risk.\nBeginning of last year when we presented the vision 2025 paper, we had identified seven\nfocus states where we would grow our business to mitigate this. Those states now contribute\n22% to the AUM. By end of the year, we should be 26% and end of next year this will be in\nthe range of 41 to 44%. End of next year, our endeavor is to ensure no state is more than 12%\nof the total AUM. This is a big step that we are taking. Currently our biggest states are in the\nrange of about 15, 15.2, 15.3. However, we have another six quarters to really moderate these\nand get the big ones down to 12%. We are comfortable with a single state contribution of\nabout 12% or below. On the disbursement, disbursement for the quarter was 2,513 Crores.\nThis was a Y-O-Y growth of 81% and a quarter-on-quarter growth of 51%. Quarter one we\ndisbursed 1,664 Crores. On the asset quality, the current book is at 96.7%. This has seen a bit\nof a dip because of the project Parivartan that I mentioned. The GNPA however, has gone\ndown. It has fallen 23 bps to 1.4% and this is quarter on quarter, if I look at a Y-O-Y it was\n7.37% as on 30th September of last year. NNPA again has seen a reduction of 7 bps over\nprevious quarter, so we are at 0.42%. So, without confusing on too many numbers, the GNPA\nin the current quarter is 1.4% and NNPA is 0.42%. We continue to maintain a PCR of 70.26%.\nOur CRAR is at a healthy 36.6%, indicating a good balance sheet position. Collection\nefficiency I have already mentioned. Net collection efficiency was 97.7% versus 98.1% so\nthat is where minus 0.4% for the reasons that I mentioned, project Parivartan. The gross\ncollection efficiency however, which is collection with the lag is at 100.3%. On the\nborrowings bit, it was a good quarter for us. We mobilized 3,191 Crores in quarter versus\n1,080 Crores last year same quarter, growth of about 195%. Happy to inform all that we added\nthree big lenders in the quarter, State Bank of India, NABARD and SIDBI. You would have\nseen the presentation our cash position also was very healthy. End of quarter the balance sheet\nhad a cash of 1850 Crores. Coming to financial performance, the total income was 640 Crores,\nwhich was a growth of 106% Y-O-Y and 21% quarter on quarter. Net income was 412 Crores,\na growth of 89%. The yield has gone up quarter on quarter and while the same quarter last\nyear was 19.5% but even on a quarter on quarter it has gone up by about 0.45%. So, it was\nabout 24% last quarter. We are at 24.5% this quarter. The NIMS of the portfolio is 14.1% an\nimprovement of 113 bps over previous year. However, down 0.11% over previous quarter.\nThis has been because of increase in the leverage which has gone up from 1.98x in previous\nquarter to 2.31 in Q2. So, we will see some compression as we continue to increase our\nleverage. We have made this position earlier that south of 4x is something that we would be\ncomfortable with. So anywhere 3.5 to 4 and once we hit that we start looking for growth\ncapital. As of now that distance is some bit away. On the PPOP we reported 258 Crores a Y-\nO-Y growth of 134% and a 36% increase over Q1. Consequently, our profit after tax this\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nquarter has been 125 Crores, which is a growth of 127% Y-O-Y and a 5% growth quarter on\nquarter. During the quarter, we also received a rating upgrade from ICRA. Our credit rating\nwas upgraded to A stable from A minus positive earlier. So now the three rating agencies, all\nof them are at par.\nTo summarize, we will end the year at about 12,000 Crores of AUM. We ended the last\nquarter at 9782, so we will end the year at 12,000 Crores this year which is exactly what we\nhave been saying over the past few quarters. This will entail disbursing about 3000 Crores\nand 3500 Crores in Q3 and Q4, which we are confident of meeting. All distribution led\ninitiatives will be completed by end of Q3 beginning of Q4. These are predominantly opening\nof new branches and entailing the cost of opening those branches and manpower because it\ntakes about 60 days to operationalize a branch. We did this so that we could prepare for a\nclean 12 months of growth next year. So, the next few months will all be about stabilizing.\nNext year, which is FY2025 will be all about focusing on growth and most importantly\nfocusing on efficiencies and productivity. We have mentioned the vision 2025 and the\nreference to vision 2025 which was essentially a three-year plan which we had come out on\nthe 11th of July 2022 giving details of where do we want to take the company over the next\nthree years which is until FY2025. Happy to inform all of you that we started working on the\nvision 2028 plan because when we came out with the vision 2025, it was a three-year plan.\nWe are already midway. We have initiated the planning exercise for the subsequent three\nyears. We should be able to share the plan by the end of the year. Suffice to add we are usually\noptimistic of what the future holds for Spandana and the same should find its way in the plan.\nI thank all the stakeholders of Spandana, the board, our lenders and our colleagues in\nSpandana who pooled in their energies during the year. A special note of thanks to all the\nbranch staff, our loan officers, branch managers, and the entire field staff who are slogging\nhard to deliver the results. Thank you to all of you who are on the call. You have been a\nconstant source of encouragement by giving us positive advice, feedback and of course\nsupport during the year. We look forward to receiving similar encouragement in the future.\nWe have the entire management team with us and are ready to take questions. Thank you\nvery much.\nModerator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question\nis from the line of Shreepal Doshi from Equirus. Please go ahead.\nShreepal Doshi: Hello Sir, good evening and thank you for giving me the opportunity. Congratulations to you\nand the entire team for the good quarter. So, my first question was pertaining to the customer\naddition, so we had guided for almost 1 million customer addition during this year, and we\nhave already added 0.61 million customers and second half being a stronger half do you\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nbelieve we will be able to surpass that guidance and do much better customer acquisition\nwhich will be lead to further better loan growth.\nShalabh Saxena: We have done about 6.1 lakh in the first two quarters. So theoretically what you are saying is\nright. But however, want you to also keep in context is the 3000 to 3500 Crores that we will\ndo. Within that yes, the one could become 1.1 maybe could be about 1.15 lakh as well beyond\nthat there is a certain mix that we have in mind which we are kind of executed. Plus, we have\na lot of unfinished work on the distribution side that we had. So yes, there is opportunity in\nthe market and what we also observed is that post the release of the pent-up demand about\nsix to eight quarters back now the demand is pretty stable so we will measure and calibrate\nour steps Shreepal. Our focus on customer acquisition will remain 1.1 million against 1\nmillion guidance is possibly a doable thing, but broadly speaking we will remain within\n12,000 Crores kind of a number and utilize that time to kind of do other distribution initiatives\nthat we have on our agenda.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it. Sir second question was pertaining to the credit cost, so during this quarter we have\nseen that increase to almost 3.9% on an annualized basis. So, could you please throw some\nlight on that, and will this run rate lead to any change in our guidance of 2% for the year?\nAshish Damani: Hi Shreepal. This is Ashish this side. So if you look at the credit cost, we have given the\nbreakup what is coming from the BAU is about 1.2%. We do have some like dated\nprovisioning that we have done which is another 2.6%. In my mind the other items, the\nARC and some correction that we had to do on the assignment portfolio that we have is\nlargely addressed. We may have some more flows, but that will be calibrated within a\nperiod of time. What is important is to look at what is coming from the BAU or the book\nthat we have created in the recent past or the book which is going to continue in the balance\nsheet and that is stacking at about 1.4% right now and I think this can be improved from\nhere on.\nShreepal Doshi: As Sir highlighted that the collection efficiency was affected because of the project\nParivartan right. So, can that also lead to an increase in credit cost requirement for the year\nor increasing flows from here on?\nAshish Damani: So, whatever is currently built in does have some bit of impact because of Parivartan as\nwell. So, it is already taken into account. Going forward we believe that things will improve\nfrom here on. It is the initial hiccup which has added to the flows and that is reflecting in\nprimarily 1 to 30 and 30 to 60 bucket. But I think further flows into 90 plus whatever the\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nnatural flow will be there that would definitely happen. But the ones which are primarily\nbecause of administrative issues should correct in the coming few months.\nShalabh Saxena: So Shreepal let me also add, will there be an impact, there is already an impact. Will it\nflow, yes little bit will flow for sure. There is no doubt about it. However, will it kind of\nsignificantly impact the guidance, no chance. We had said that it will be sub of 2% we are\nbelow that where this is a pain of one quarter which we had to take because the model in\nour wisdom had to be made scalable which we kind of walked that path. Once we are there,\nwe kind of set right about 15 lakh customers and about 700 branches rest obviously the 300\nbranches are functioning and this year we have no plan to do anything on those 300\nbranches. The new branches are either way weekly so that part is sorted already. So, all\nthese initiatives in our wisdom have to be taken if you really want to take Spandana to\n17,000 Crores and a stable and a robust model is what we have kind of planned for and this\nis a step in that direction. Yes, we will have an impact probably in this quarter also, but this\nis all temporary because these are customers who are with us. It is just that entire disruption\nin terms of our schedule and their schedule has kind of not really aligned well and with 1.5\nmillion base these things are anticipated. So hence we chose July and August month to\nkind of execute this so that we can cover up by the month of March of this year.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it Sir. Thank you so much for the detailed answer. Sir one last question was pertaining\nto the collection efficiency again. Sir have we seen any impact in collection efficiency in\nBihar or UP sort of states where in there was derailment in collection efficiency because\nof rainfall or monsoon.\nAshish Damani: So, we did our analysis. Our chief risk officer, he did a detailed analysis on both the drought\nwhich is the short rainfall and wherever there was excess rainfall, the impact of both which\nis deficient as well as wherever there was higher, the total portfolio impact was about 2.5\nor 3% of our entire books. So, per say and this exercise we did just about I think about four\nweeks or three weeks back when this thing was very right. So immediately Bihar we have\na book, which is reasonably manageable. We are doing a very, very calibrated approach in\neach of these growth states and we are fine. We have not seen any drop or any stress if that\nis the question.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it Sir. So, the collection efficiency would broadly be like what I mean 94-95% for that\n2.5% portfolio or would it be even lower than that.\nAshish Damani: So specific question to Bihar, the collection efficiency actually is better than the national\naverage.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nShreepal Doshi: Got it Sir.\nShalabh Saxena: Because this is a very standard question which gets asked. We have not experienced any\nspecific stress in any of the states that we are talking about. Wherever there are issues, they\nare more internal than a market or environment. So hence that is a matter of solace for us\nand everybody in the industry. But yes of course, we would be very careful when we lend\nand as I said lend short, lend muted.\nShreepal Doshi: Got it Sir. Thank you so much for answering all my questions. Good luck for the next\nquarter.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Renish Bhuva from ICICI Securities.\nPlease go ahead.\nRenish Bhuva: Yes, hi Sir. Congrats on a good set of numbers. Sir just two questions from my side, one\non the customer acquisition side, so in this quarter, the new customer addition is actually\nat par with the industry leader in fact it is higher than that. So just wanted to understand\nwhat percentage of this customer are let us say unique to us and maybe if you can just\nfurther share whether we will be what second, third lender or will we be let us say first or\nsecond lender?\nShalabh Saxena: So, Renish good evening. I will give you the stats. It is not just specific to 3.5. I am just\ngiving you a flavor because it becomes a more slightly wider answer, 33 to 34% of our\ncustomer base, it was about 36% last quarter. We are 34% is a single lender relation with\nSpandana and another 33% is 1 + 1 which is apart from Spandana there is one more. So,\nthis takes it to about 68-69. We have about 19% with the 1 + 2 and then the others are, once\nthey take a loan from us, then they go and kind of borrow from somewhere else, but what\nwe have also been observing Renish, is doing a lot of analytics in terms of is there a\ncorrelation of either a ticket size or a number of lenders to the repayment behavior of the\ncustomers. Until now we have not really seen any that is number one. Number two our\nfocus will be on moving into geographies where we increase the single lender relationship\nbecause single lender relationship also is a factor of our existing customer base and how\nmuch they want. So given the fact that we have normalized our operations, you will see a\nlot of these things, the 33-34% touching the 38, 39, 40%. If you go back to my Q1 earnings\ncall we had said that our desire is that single lender and a one plus one should be a 38, 39\nequivalent, so about 78, 79 should be one or 1 + 1. So that is the distance that we have to\ntravel, and we are walking that path that in our wisdom weekly repayment helps us in that\nplus now out in the market from a customer point of view Spandana is acknowledged as a\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nstable lender which when they need there is a credit demand, and this is a credit they need\na periodic dose of capital for running their regular businesses. Once they have that\nconfidence, you will see this number increasing so that is how we are approaching the\nbusiness.\nRenish Bhuva: Got it and just to follow up on that, so let us say the customer pool, wherein the lender\nrelationship is 1 + 2 and above, what could be the industry level outstanding for borrower.\nShalabh Saxena: Renish see at a point in time hamara philosophy kya hai, hamara philosophy hai 2 Tak. I\nmean it does not really ring a bell with us. So, we will continue to acquire more and more\ncustomer which is the earlier question Shreepal asked, so we will continue to focus on that\nand hence our experience is on a customer ticket size, we are very well entrenched, and we\nare very well in our capacity to ensure that we are able to hold on to our customer. I mean\nas in right now we have about 2.7 million so that is what it is. What is very critical is the\nshare of wallet increases and to the extent possible if required even if a customer has a\nvintage of seven years or eight years, we are still stuck at our maximum ticket size of\n80,000 not more. So, we are continuing to follow that philosophy and I think we will\nprogress.\nAshish Damani: I will just add. Hi Renish, our exposure at a customer level is 36,800 thereabouts. If you\nlook at the industry average should be hovering around, you know 40 to 43,000. So, if you\nadd my borrower, my loan plus another loan we are talking about 80,000 or somewhere\nthere if, unless somebody has given loan which are like three years and all then this number\ncan increase but otherwise this should be hovering around, so given that we do not have\nthree years loan. We have all two year at best. I think our kind of customer should be in\nthat range of 70 to 80,000 maximum exposure in that one plus one that you talked about.\nShalabh Saxena: So, you asked a very important question Renish, and I am just adding a nuance to it. What\nwe track is not the ticket size, what we track is the indebtedness level, our indebtedness\nlevel today is about 36,000 and this I can say with reasonable surety either will remain\nstatic at this number or will keep going down which is exactly the opposite of how the\nindustry is moving but we are very comfortable with this position. Our philosophy remains\nand this is what we believe in. You will never lose a customer either on interest rate or\nticket size. You will lose a customer on your conduct, the way you kind of approach the\ncustomer, the way you deal with them. If you are transparent, if you are honest, if you\nmaintain a cordial relationship with them and ensure that the credit supply is taken care of,\ntheir credit demand is taken care of, you are there.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nRenish Bhuva: Got it. Sorry to follow up on that. So let me put it this way. What is our credit filters?\nWherein if the system level indebtedness of the customer goes let us say about 1 lakh or\nabove 80,000 will not lend. We have that kind of credit filters in our process or no.\nShalabh Saxena: It works in the reverse. Given the FOIR and the 1.5 lakh that is automatic ceiling. My\nrejection at this point in time is 45% and the only way to reduce that rejection is to increase\nthe tenor from 24 to 36 or 48 which either way we do not have. So as a policy we are\nrejecting the higher number for the reasons that I said because we think this is the right\nway to do.\nAshish Damani: So, I will just bring down that. The way you can disburse a loan is maximum tenure can be\nonly two years and within that FOIR eligibility. So, either your amount will go down or\nthe loan will be rejected altogether that is how it works.\nRenish Bhuva: Got it and just last question from my side on the credit cost. So, Ashish you did mention\nthat this 58 Crores in this quarter is related to the past book but let us say in next two\nquarters what kind of impairment we still expect from the past book, or this is the last leg,\nand we are completely done with the past impairment.\nAshish Damani: So, there are two pieces to this, Renish. One is ARC book that we have on the balance\nsheet. The total outstanding on the balance sheet is about 164 Crores. We carry a provision\nof 34 Crores which emanates from the ratings that are given by the trustee and the rating\nagency, so the provision is driven by that. We are confident that we will be able to collect\nmost of the ARC pool. So further provisioning may not be required in my mind, but if it\nhappens it should happen gradually over a period of time that is part one. The other part is\nmore about the assignment transaction, and it is a calibration that we have been doing\naround this. What we have on the balance sheet presently uncovered or let us say what we\nhave already paid as advance to the banks and needs to be addressed in the balance sheet\nis about 16.6-17 Crores roughly, let us say. Having said that we are in a business where we\nneed to keep taking the interest from the banks perspective as well and keep having a\nreserve around this so one can expect let us say I am just estimating a 40 to 50 Crores kind\nof a number over a period of time, not necessarily immediate or whatever, but I am just\ndoing a future gazing here in a way that is the number I have in mind and we will be\ncomfortable with that if at all that happens.\nRenish Bhuva: Got it. Again, I mean if we have only 17-18 Crores which is there on the balance sheet then\nwhy we are saying 40-50 Crores.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nShalabh Saxena: Renish this is future. This could happen is what Ashish is saying. While our efforts on the\nfield continues, we are just defining the scope and the limit to what the discussion that we\nare having at this point in time. It is not that this will happen next quarter or the next three\nquarters or four quarters. We are saying that is the total quantum of issue to be addressed\nwhile our efforts on the field continue that is the max that we are talking about. That is the\npoint Ashish was mentioning.\nRenish Bhuva: Got it. Okay that is it from my side Sir. Best of luck Sir.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sagar Shah from Piper Serica. Please go\nahead.\nSagar Shah: Good evening, Sir and first of all congratulations for such a healthy set of numbers. I just\nhad one question actually basically that was related on your slide #8 actually. So, my query\nwas that when I am seeing from 1 to 30-day bucket and from 31 to 60-day bucket, I am\nseeing a little bit deterioration in the asset quality, the 1 to 30 day bucket has gone up for\nthe first time from 0.55 to 0.85 and 31 to 60 has gone from 0.42 to 0.60 and it has increased\nfor the first time in the last six odd quarters actually. So, my query was that are we actually\nstarted seeing some stress which we have not seen actually for the last several quarters in\nthis microfinance space. And if yes, then can you give some colour on that please?\nAshish Damani: Hi good evening, Sagar thanks for the question. I think this is partly covered in the opening\nremarks made by Shalabh. I will try to explain this in a little more detail. The movement\nthat you see in the SMA buckets primarily can be attributed to the Parivartan project that\nthe company has taken up. We have moved almost about 700 branches in last quarter from\na monthly kind of an exercise where we used to collect between 1st and 10th of the month\nto a weekly kind of a setup where we are asking customers to make the payments in the\nfirst week of the particular month which is Monday to Friday. So in this there is\nadministrative issue where the customers are still not aligned to the new thought process\nand that is what is creating a little bit of slipovers. So if you see our overall collection on\nthe gross basis is still 100.3% which means people are paying with some lag and there are\nsome miss outs that have happened which will catch up as we progress and I think what\nwe believe is in another three to four months you could see this again normalizing and\ngoing back to levels where we were in the past.\nShalabh Saxena: So, Sagar, I covered this at a length in my opening remark, but broadly, our company used\nto follow a collection cycle of first to 10 which was a date, and the balance 20 days was for\na disbursement and member acquisition. What we have done is we thought the right thing\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nto do was to do all the three things which is collect, disburse, and acquire new customers\nevery single day of the 20-21 days that you work. So, we moved in 700 branches covering\n1.5 million customers from the date to a day which is instead of 1st to 10th now we are\nseeing Monday to Friday. We came out with a schedule to the customer saying that your\ninstallment is not on e.g. 8th but it is on Wednesday or Thursday or Friday and this reaching\nto 15 lakh customers for a scale of this obviously there was to be a disruption that is why\nwe chose this quarter. We were fully aware of the risk.\nSagar Shah: Okay sure Sir and my last question Sir was related to credit cost. As you already highlighted\nthere was a one off in the quarter related to restructuring. So that is how our credit cost was\nlittle high at 90 Crores. So can you give a guidance of our credit cost for FY2024 and for\nFY2025 also.\nShalabh Saxena: If you look at our slide, our credit cost is 1.4% only, the balance that is towards the FRs\nand some assignment transaction that we have done. I do not want to really take up the\ntime of the others, but you can separately reach out to us and then we will get in touch with\nyou.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from Rajiv Mehta from YES Securities. Please go ahead.\nRajiv Mehta: Hi Shalabh and Ashish. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to ask questions and\ncongrats on demonstrating significant scale up of the franchise. So, first question is on the\nportfolio yield. So, portfolio yield has improved from 24% to 24.5% but the interest income\nhas grown exactly in line with loan portfolio that is by 10-11% so does it imply that a good\npart of the growth that keeps on the quarter was slightly back ended, and a true reflection\nof the higher yield will come in Q3?\nAshish Damani: Hi Rajiv, good evening. So, I think the entire growth is in line with the portfolio growth\nand the reflection of the yield is nothing but whatever the top line growth has been. What\nhowever happens is we have done two DA transactions which will move some of the\nincome related to the quarter as well into the other line item apart from the preponing of\nincome because of the DA transaction which is almost about 42 Crores which has gone\ninto the other income line item that gives you some aberration. In terms of as far as portfolio\nyield is concerned, I think we are very much there may be another 10 to 20 bps is what you\ncan see.\nShalabh Saxena: So, the history is Rajiv, post the March regulations we increased the interest rate the first\ntime around in June of 2022, so we had taken up our IRR from 21.97 to 24% in October,\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nwhich is 12th of October 2022, which was last year, we took it up to 25. So, for the past\nfour quarters we have been stable at the same interest rate. So, the yield on account of the\ndelta on interest rate has I think kind of come one full year on a portfolio point of view, so\nnow what you will see is not what the delta on account of increase in the rate, but more on\naccount of the denominator increasing which will kind of progress as we move.\nAshish Damani: And just to cover the question in two numbers, 7% was the increase in the average AUM.\nThe increase in the top line, interest income has been around 10% so those are the numbers\nfor you Rajiv.\nRajiv Mehta: Shalabh you also said that customer level indebtedness will remain static or maybe even\nslightly come down. So, when you speak about indebtedness, you are talking about our\naverage outstanding to the customer borrower.\nShalabh Saxena: Correct.\nRajiv Mehta: So then does it not imply that customer retention or portfolio will not improve because\nnaturally as your processes, your things are becoming much and much better the customer\nstickiness and the customer attention should improve and the migration into subsequent\ncycles will left the overall blended outstanding per borrower but I agree that you will also\nadd new clients but can it not improve I am just asking.\nShalabh Saxena: So, what you are saying is right. However, for the next one year so there are two parts we\nare discussing, we are discussing numbers, we are discussing philosophy. From a\nphilosophy point of view, we will always be on the lower end of the ticket sizes, and which\nis what in the early part of the conversation we said that our maximum ticket you are\noperating at is 80,000 which is substantially lower than the industry. What you are saying\nis right. However, for the next year when we continue to pursue our customer acquisition\nled growth. By design we offer our customer a first cycle loan at 35,000 you will see that\nnumber being stabilized at 36,000 or thereabouts. One year hence when currently our\nproportion of new versus vintage customer is about 50:50. The day we start coming down\nto a 30% new and 70% existing that is when the 36 will start inching up and that will\neventually play out say about six quarters from now. But however, the 36 is unlikely to\nbecome a 46 or a 48. At best 36 will be 37, 38, 39 that is the range that we are comfortable\nin, sub 40,000 indebtedness even for an existing customer base is a number that we should\nbe comfortable with.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nRajiv Mehta: So, what is your thoughts about your tenure per officer or officer to assets ratio, it may be\nin the medium to longer term where can we reach from where we are.\nShalabh Saxena: So, we have done this benchmarking. We are at an enterprise level we are currently at 347\nto a loan officer, so we are at a AUM currently is 1.2 excluding trainees, and our loan\nofficers are handling 317 borrowers per loan officer. However, 317 Rajiv is a number and\nthis 317 is because we have added a lot of branches and loan officers etc. This will\nimmediately in the short term hit in the neighborhood of about 380 to 400 borrowers per\nloan officer which next year we are targeting of 440 to 450 number. On the AUM side, we\nare currently at a 1.2. We are targeting a 1.4 to 1.5 over the next three to four quarters. That\nis the number we are targeting. On the AUM side 1.4 to 1.5 is the number that I foresee\nstabilizing and on the borrower to loan officer, I think a number anywhere between 450 to\n480 is a number that we will be comfortable with. We in our best of times done a 600 also\nin our previous company but those days were different. So now anywhere 450 to 470 is a\ngood enough number with a 1.5 Crores of corresponding portfolio. Sorry for the long\nanswer.\nRajiv Mehta: Thanks for this. Just a couple of observations and then I would like to hear your comments.\nAnd this is my last question. We have seen some addition even in the monthly collection\nmodel branches. Second question is about the growth in loan officers on sequential basis\nhas just been 4%. So, I am asking this question in the context of significant number of\nbranches that we have added.\nShalabh Saxena: Okay understood. So, the monthly addition is because of the split branches because the\nbranches sometimes outgrow their capability. When a branch starts stocking a 20 Crores\nkind of a portfolio you have no option but to administratively split otherwise it becomes a\nslightly riskier branch from cash handling etc., perspective so all of this either will follow\nour model of transforming from a monthly to weekly. On the loan officer count I think\nRajiv, we have kind of reached where we wanted to maybe another 500-700 and we are\ndone for in terms of recruitment. Our branch addition and recruitment we kind of done\nwhatever we had to which was my point in the commentary when I said that we have taken\nthe cost. We have done all the investments in the distribution. Now it is all about,\nefficiencies and productivity.\nRajiv Mehta: Thank you so much and best of luck.\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Abhijit Tibrewal from Motilal Oswal.\nPlease go ahead.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Good evening, everyone and congrats Shalabh and Ashish on a good quarter. So just two\nquestions, the first one is more of a data keeping question. Ashish if you could just tell us\nwhat is the DA outstanding as on September?\nAshish Damani: 732 Crores.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Alright thank you and the other thing is this time around you already shared I think around\n42 Crores coming from the DA transaction which you showed as value change. So is this\nunderstanding right that I mean all the upfronting or what we call as finite income, when\nyou undertake a DA transaction, you are booking it as that you do not show that.\nAshish Damani: That is right Abhijit. This will include the income that you would have booked in the\ninterest income between the date of cut off and the date of transaction as well.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. So essentially if you do a retransaction 45 days into the quarter, 45 days of interest\nincome gets booked as net gain on fair value changes.\nAshish Damani: It may be 45 days; it may be 25 days depending upon where did I pick up the portfolio\nfrom which date onwards that is the way to think.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Understood and this time around we have reported net gain 60 Crores, 42 is coming from\nthis DA transaction that you did and other 18 Crores is coming from?\nAshish Damani: So whatever cash that we have we park it into overnight funds with the mutual fund\ncompanies and the income interest come from there.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: So even the treasury income is classified in the net gain on share value changes. Got it.\nLast question I had is I mean while you have already articulated maybe the yields will go\nup by 10-20 basis points. So, two parts to this one is I mean on yields do you think there is\nsome regulatory risk not specifically to you but given how I mean other peers and the\ninterest rates at which they are lending do you think there is a regulatory risk of again some\nkind of a capping coming in and the other question is specifically on your cost of\nborrowings. I am seeing Ashish sequentially your incremental cost of borrowing has\nremained stable, very heartening to hear that you have added three big lenders during this\nquarter. SBI, NABARD, and SIDBI. So based on how discussions are progressing, I am\nhoping you will look to add more maybe PSU banks lending relationships going forward.\nSo how should the cost of borrowing kind of trend incrementally as well on portfolio basis\ngoing forward?\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nAshish Damani: I will answer the cost of borrowing and then I will hand it over to Shalabh on the industry\nview for how the interest rates are likely to move. In terms of cost of borrowings, yes as\nwe progress we should see more improvement in the marginal cost of borrowings for us\nbut if you overlook at the moment in terms of our cost of borrowing it has been between\nabout 130 bps between last year and this year and if I have to look at how the overall\ninterest rates on the repo side has moved, it is also like close to about 240-250 basis points.\nSo from that respect we have been doing well. Having said that I agree as the participation\nfrom the public sector banks improve and the mix changes, we should start seeing some\nbenefits on the borrowing side.\nShalabh Saxena: So, I will just supplement what Ashish said. What was left in our kitty over the public\nsector enterprises so by design this cost of the borrowing should go down that is our\nestimate, that is our guess, and it is a logical guess. Now to your first question on the interest\nrates and NIMS that are being charged. Now specific to us we are currently at 14.1% NIM.\nOur gearing is just 2.3. If our gearing goes to a 4 which it will eventually. One has to\noperate at a 3.5 to 4 X, the NIMS should settle anywhere at about 12, 12.5 add about 2%\nof credit cost and cost of operations so you are talking of roughly about 4, 4.5, 5%. So 4.5%\nis what we have said that we are currently at 7% but I think on AUM basis I think we\nshould settle anywhere on a long term basis at about 5, 5.5% and add another on the credit\ncost you will have 4.5 to 5% of ROA, so your question in terms of do we see any\nintervention, look this is a physical model which is a very expensive model. One has to\nphysically deploy a lot of people and for all practical purposes they have to be monitored\nwhich entails a lot of cost and hence 5, 5.5, 6% you need that amount to run the company.\nAt a point in time if there is a question from anywhere by regulator, there are others also\nwho asked this question. We have a perfectly valid reason that for unsecure micro finance\nlending 4, 4.5, 5% is a very much doable levels and limits that we are at. We also have to\nensure that as an industry we lend responsibly and when we say lend responsibly means\nthat the interest rates that we are talking about and industry if you see the big players, the\ntop ten players if I remember correctly contribute about 90% to the industry, most of them\nare in the median of the number which is a tolerable number. So, it is a number which is a\nlogical number to operate. We balance the interests of all the stakeholders. So, per say our\npersonal view is that if we continue to operate in this space, we should be fine. However,\nif there are questions, we will be happy to answer anybody outside.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. Thank you so much for the update. That is all from my side. All the very best to you\nShalabh, Ashish, and Spandana team.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sarvesh Gupta from Maximal Capital.\nPlease go ahead.\nSarvesh Gupta: Good evening, Sir and congratulations for a good set of numbers. Sir one question on the\nother loan product, so as part of our vision 2025, we had also said we will reach 3000\nCrores in other NMFI so what is the progress there till now given that we are six quarters\naway?\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you for asking this question, Sarvesh. We have opened ten branches in Rajasthan. I\nthink last time we had updated that we are going to expand in Rajasthan this is under our\nsubsidiary Criss Financials, so we opened ten branches. We have disbursed in the loan\nagainst property while we are still finding our feet, but we are progressing really well. We\nhave disbursed about 3.5 Crores and done about 105, 106 loans. On the nano MSME loans\nwe just opened this up, I think about last month of the quarter. Last quarter we have done\nabout 25 lakhs and 27 loans. We have 60 people already in the ten branches that we have\nspoken about. All of these are people from the industry, and I think I clarified this last time.\nThis is a separate market, separate branch, separate set of people and even in the head office\nat the chief business officer level, there are separate set of individuals kind of looking at it\nbecause this entails setting up a full-fledged credit department if you are looking into it.\nThis has nothing to do with micro finance so that is why we demarketed it and kept both\nthe models separate. Our plan is to take the number up to 50 branches by end of this year.\nI think we should do about roughly 75 Crores to 100 Crores by the end of the year. Next\nyear is when we scale up and we will scale pretty fast. We are just trying to even out all\nthe rough edges that we have in terms of system because there is a new system that we\nhave taken. This is not the microfinance system. So new system, new setup, new\nenvironment, new market, new set of people. All of this, we are just socializing ourselves\nand once done towards the later part of Q4, we kind of step up to deliver the plans that we\nhave communicated.\nSarvesh Gupta: Understood Sir and just one thing, one clarification on the credit cost part. So, if I\nunderstand this correctly this 58 odd Crores which has come up, so only 40 to 50 Crores\nwhich is from assignment transaction is the sort of the further flow into this sort of number\nwhich can happen as far as our pre 2021 book is concerned and nothing else is sort of under\nquestion as of now.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, so Sarvesh there were two pieces to it. One you got it right on the DA part. We do\nhave 128 Crores of unprovided ARC portfolio which is there, which we are very confident\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nof recovering that is there on the balance sheet. In case in future, we are not able to recover,\nwe will have to take some bit of cognizance of that.\nSarvesh Gupta: And remaining is the assignment which is 40 to 50 Crores over a period time.\nShalabh Saxena: That is right.\nSarvesh Gupta: So at least in one quarter you may not see this sort of a number going forward.\nShalabh Saxena: No.\nSarvesh Gupta: Understood and in the project Parivartan which might have some impact on your credit\ncost on this quarter in terms of flows so 1.3% that we have got is inclusive of that hence\nwe should expect this sort of a number going forward as well or do we think that the real\nsort of increase is going to come in the coming quarters from this?\nShalabh Saxena: So, we will see some flows in this quarter as well. Yes, the 1.4% is a part of this. However,\nwe are trying our best to kind of ensure that it remains within the original limits that we\nhave been delivering over the past few quarters. However, having said that our overall\nnumber that we have been very consistent in what we have been saying. We will be sub of\n2% that we are very confident of meeting.\nSarvesh Gupta: Understood Sir. Just one final question on the district concentration do we track that and is\nit in line with what we wanted to achieve? I understood the state wise guidance.\nShalabh Saxena: So, we do all of that, the branch, district, state, zone, all of that we do but the larger point\nis Sarvesh, and I would urge, and I would draw your attention to is our top three states are\n41-42%. They contribute 41-42% to our overall kitty. I do not know if you have that slide\nin front of you but if you go to the annexure slide 20 my top two states are 15 and rest all\nthe states are sub-11. If you go back to the commentary that I said we said that exit 25 none\nof the states will be more than 12% so which means two state Odisha and Madhya Pradesh\nhave to come down from the current 15 to 12% so this will come out one increase in\ndenominator and the second is obviously there are certain pockets of inefficiencies which\nwe kind of shut the tap on which is going to get us to that number. So, the concentration\nnorm and the corresponding mitigation is something that we are very, very clear in our\nhead that is what we are driving. I do not think we will take more than six quarters to kind\nof get to 12% across all states and the highest will be a 12% and the rest will be below.\nSarvesh Gupta: Sure, Sir. Congratulations again and wish you all the best.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nModerator: Thank you. The last question is from the line of Anand Mundra from Soar Wealth. Please\ngo ahead.\nAnand Mundra: Good evening, Sir. Congratulations on good set of results. I wanted to check on slide\nnumber 7 your current book percentage has come down so I could not understand this from\n97.1 to 96.7.\nAshish Damani: Anand this is same as what we have been discussing about so some of the payments are\ndelayed so they have been classified in the 1 to 30 bucket and that is why you see the\ncurrent number has gone down by 40 basis points.\nAnand Mundra: See what I understood from current and old number, one is current book, and one is a pre\nCOVID book that is how the percentage is.\nAshish Damani: Zero-day delinquency.\nAnand Mundra: Okay second Sir I wanted to check how many branches we have moved to weekly\ncollection now.\nShalabh Saxena: I will give you the December position. I think there is a slide also that we have put up here\nwhich is split into operational and not operational. We are already at 1502 branches of\nwhich about 95 odd branches are yet to start operations exit December which is two months\naway rough and ready about 370 to 380 branches should be weekly, when this all gets over,\nI think we should be at about 450. These are all organic branches which existing monthly\nfor whatever we are going to transform all of that will slowly start playing out in Q4 and\nthen Q1 from next year onwards.\nAnand Mundra: Sir this problem of increase in SMA2 and GNPA that will continue for another three or\nfour quarters from the time you are moving everything to weekly branches.\nShalabh Saxena: There is no link between the two. The new branches are weekly model, so there I see no\nchange now. We have moved to day instead of 1st to 10th we have moved Monday to Friday,\nwe are not doing it now in those branches, these branches which I said will take about three\nmonths, max four months and then we will be sorted. The other branches, 300 branches\nwhich are monthly are very big branches, so we are not touching them for now. Once let\nus do this and which is why I keep on making that statement that exit 2025 or end of\nFY2025 Spandana will be 80% weekly, not 100.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nOctober 30, 2023\nAnand Mundra: Okay noted Sir, Sir one more thing, how much bad debt recovery happened in this quarter\nor six months?\nShalabh Saxena: H1 we have recovered 54 Crores. Last year write off recovery was about 39 last year, H1\nis 54 Crores, and we are targeting upwards of 100 Crores which is another 50 odd Crores\nin the balance.\nAnand Mundra: Okay and Sir with respect to collection efficiency since you have moved some branches to\nweekly, how this has been calculated now 97.7 percentage, so you are calculating\nseparately?\nShalabh Saxena: There is nothing to do with monthly or weekly. The definition for net collection efficiency\nis very simple. It was due on the day. Did you collect on the day or not? We have kept it\nso simple and did not complicate it, gross is what has come from lag.\nAnand Mundra: With respect to net collection, you are saying that you are taking date wise not month wise.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, it will happen on different days so at the end, let me make it simple for the September\nmonth, for September if there is a due from a customer, if it comes or not otherwise it will\ngo down.\nAnand Mundra: So, Sir you will see at the end of the month whether it is weekly or any day on the month\ncorrect.\nShalabh Saxena: We monitor every day but obviously from a representation point of view we have to draw\na line somewhere and present, so we follow that.\nAnand Mundra: Sir this gross collection and net collection the difference being the excess largely would be\nprepayment.\nShalabh Saxena: Say for example, if I had 100 due in the month of September, I collected 90. I am just\ntheoretically saying I collected 90, so 10 will be there. If the next month this I get 90 and\nthis last month 10 comes next month, then the next month net will be 90 and gross will be\n20.\nAnand Mundra: Understood Sir. I am done. Thanks a lot.\nModerator: Thank you very much. That was the last question in queue. I would now like to hand the\nconference back to the management team for closing comments.\n",

Thank you, and over to you, sir.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you very much, Zico. Thank you all for joining the call and investing time in\nunderstanding the journey of Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited. As we present our results\non a really auspicious day, our journey into the company now is 7 quarters. The new\nmanagement that is Spandana 2.0 has been steering the ship now for more than 7 quarters. The\njourney has been exciting with a lot of learnings. The entire management team is very excited\nabout shaping the company to make it future ready. Let me take you through the updates for the\nquarter.\nQuarter 3 was a quarter where we crossed a major milestone by reaching an AUM of INR10,404\ncrores. This is the first time as an enterprise we have crossed the INR10,000 crores mark. Also\nfrom a profitability point of view, our PAT for the 9 months period was or is INR372 crores\nwhich has surpassed the full year profits of Spandana Sphoorty of the past many years.\nSo the story from an AUM perspective, from a profitability perspective seems to be on track.\nThere are, however, learnings which I'll cover in the subsequent narrative. On 11th of December\n2023, which is just the last year or rather a few days prior to the results that we are presenting,\nwe held our first-ever in-person analyst, investor, lender and stakeholders meet at Mumbai.\nTitled Spandana 2.0 Invested in Bharat, the entire senior management of the company presented\ntheir articulation of where and how they propose to steer their respective functions to the larger\ndelivery of the organizational goals. The event was attended by more than 120 participants and\nwe thank all of them for coming over and spending their precious time with us.\nA first for Spandana, the event was watched live by our over 12,500 employees. With Vision\n2025 halfway through, we presented the progress we have made against the benchmarks we had\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nset for ourselves. In the meeting, we also articulated our Vision 28 and the theme was 28 by 28,\nthat is a portfolio of INR28,000 crores by FY 2028.\nNow let me go to the regular operational updates for the quarter. Let me start with the rating\nupdate. We have had a few rating changes over the past few weeks, ICRA rating for Spandana.\nSo there has been a change in outlook from A stable to A positive. In CRISIL, CRISIL rating\nfor Spandana, there's a change in outlook from A stable to A positive. So we've had a change in\noutlook in both ICRA and CRISIL.\nAll of you are aware that we have a subsidiary called Criss Financials. There, we've had a rating\nupgrade from ICRA from the BBB+ stable to A- positive. So overall, the rating update and the\nprogress we are making on ratings is very much on track, and we'll continue to do all the things\nthat are required to ensure that we create a robust organization for the future. Now let me give\nan update on branch opening and business update. During the quarter, we opened 72 branches.\nWe now have 1,574 branches, of which weekly branches are 375. This also includes 18 new\nbranches opened during the year for Loan Against Property and Nano Loans under our\nsubsidiary Criss Financials. Over time, we have highlighted our faith in pursuing the weekly\nJLG model of microfinance. For the quarter, we disbursed -- which is the last quarter, we\ndisbursed INR407 crores in the weekly branches, which is 16% of the total disbursement in the\nquarter.\nWe now have a portfolio of INR535 crores in the weekly branches, which are currently\ndelivering a net collection efficiency of 99.7%. We will continue to pursue our journey to move\nthe company into the weekly model, which now brings me to the Parivartan project, which we\nhad launched in the month of July 2023.\nLet me just spend a few minutes here because it's very, very important that we are able to\ncommunicate the change that we are wanting to bring in the organization. We are wanting to\ncommunicate to you the challenges in that change. While the easier option for us as a team was\nto continue BAU, however, the model then which we are now trying to change was, we believe,\nwhat we had -- there were challenges in scalability of the model and most importantly, in our\nwisdom, what is right for the company.\nWe continue to progress on taking all initiatives to ensure that we do what is right for the\norganization. We will see some blips here and there in the quarter, but the long-term story has\nto be intact and which is what we are doing -- what we are attempting to do. In the last update,\nwhen we had come out with our Q2 results, I had elaborated our attempt at rejigging the\ndistribution model to better align with the way we think it would deliver optimum results in the\nfuture and a first step to move the monthly branches to weekly repayment branches.\nAccordingly, we had launched Project Parivartan across 730 branches Pan-India, which covered\n1.6 million customers. I will repeat, 16 lakh customers or 1.6 million customers across 730\nbranches were in the scope of the Parivartan model. While we had detailed the project last time\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\naround and had given a heads up on the disruption it would cost to our immediate business, there\nare many of you who reached out to us and advised us to elaborate on the project.\nAnd most importantly, how much more time it would take to normalize. Also, there were a few\npeople who asked why was it done at all? I will try to answer that. I did answer the why was it\ndone at all. Very clearly, we want to make the organization and the distribution model scalable.\n10,400 is where we have reached. We will end the FY'25, which is next year in thereabouts of\nINR15,000 crores, which is what we've been speaking to all of you about, with an asset quality\nof sub of 2% or rather credit loss of under 2%; ROAs of 4.5% and above; and NIM's of 13.5%\nand above.\nKeeping all of this in mind, scalability of the model is very, very important. The robustness of\nthe model and the strength of the model independently is extremely critical. And hence, we've\ndecided to walk the talk. Like when we took over, we had written off a chunk of the portfolio,\nwhich was not good. We, as a management, are -- will not deter to bite the bullet when required.\nWe thought this was required. This is needed for the company.\nThis is absolutely essential that there is a long-term story in our institution. And hence, we are\ncontinuing with this. So hear our take once again. The earlier distribution model of the company\nwas designed as monthly repayment, number one. Number two, collection cycle was from first\nuntil tenth of the month. Number three, disbursement was 11th onwards until 30th, 31st of the\nmonth.\nWhile there was no restriction, but practically in the collection days, -there -were hardly any\ndisbursement and the disbursement was focused on the balance 20 days. We wanted to alter the\nabove model to make it more distributed across the month, convert the repayment to a weekly\ncycle, and most importantly, ensure that all the three things core to microfinance, that is new\nmember acquisition, disbursement and collection, happen on all days of the month and not on\nselective dates or days.\nThis is very, very important friends and hence I'm kind of belaboring this point. In microfinance,\nour stop and start model does not work in our limited experience. You have to do disbursement,\nyou have to do new member acquisition. You have to do the collection all in one go, in the same\ntime, in the same geography in the communities that you offer -- that you operate in. And hence,\nthe Parivartan was a necessity.\nSo accordingly, we picked 730 branches Pan-India, which had about INR5,500 crores. Portfolio\nis about 53% of the book, across 1.6 million customers where we launched Parivartan in across\nthe months of July and August last year. In this, the repayment was changed. So what we did\nwas we changed the repayment from dates to days, which means instead of the installment date\nof first, second, third, fourth, we said now your installment will be either on a Monday of the\nweek or a Tuesday under specific time.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nSo the dates were converted in to days. This was a precursor to the weekly model that is generally\nprevalent across. And even in our company, the 375 branches, they operate on a regular week,\nMonday to Friday, all the three things collection, disbursement and new member acquisition,\nhappen all -- every single day. In this -- so I'll repeat again, in this, the repayment was changed\nfrom dates to days.\nThe 10 days repayment was compressed to weekly, that is week 1, week 2 and so on. This was\na precursor to move into the weekly repayment model for new loans. This required a change in\nthe repayment dates, change in center meeting day and time and changes in the loan officer as\nwell means the schedule of the loan officers also had to undergo a change.\nBecause of the wide scale and the fact that this involved almost about 5,000 loan officers, which\nis 55% of the loan officers. There were many instances wherein scheduled repayment dates were\nmissed by customers or our loan officers could not reach on time. Thus, due data collection took\na hit, resulting in the branch staff going to customers again during the month to collect the\nmonthly installments.\nHence, a lot of time was invested in redoing the process by the branch staff, reaching out to the\ncustomers, going for collections again, thus leading to a wastage of productive time. In many\nbranches post the transition, our staff were engaged in doing the rounds of the customers through\nthe month, thus impacting our disbursement cadence, which, as you would have seen in the\nmonth of October, our disbursement was probably about INR400 -- INR450 crores short than\nwhat we would have wanted, which we kind of got back to normal in the month of November\nand December.\nBut this was the immediate impact on the specific months that I spoke about. Apart from this,\nthere were slippages in the portfolio also across the buckets for the reasons that I mentioned.\nJust to give you some numbers, about 49,000 borrowers who are a part of the SMA bucket,\nwhich -- they contribute about 61% of the AUM in that bucket. So the impact was trade, likewise,\nif I were to look at GNPA, we are talking of 38,000 borrowers where 56% of the GNPA was\nfrom the Parivartan branches.\nSo the point I'm trying to make is, if we were to scope the problem, the problem is on 2.9 million\ncustomer base that we have. We are talking of 49,000 borrowers or 38,000 in the GNPA bucket.\nNow that they have flown already, we will definitely go and collect. But the point is larger point\nis this is to answer many questions and concerns that were raised while we've been actively\nengaged with most of you is why do this at all.\nWe are doing it because we want to take the company to an immediate 15,000 and an eventual\n28,000 by FY'28. The model, which was, at that time, prevalent, which we are attempting to\nchange, obviously, was not a scalable model. And that's why we are working the way we are. So\nwe've come, however, a long way since then. Of course, a lot of labor for the branch stuff, a lot\nof hard times for us and most importantly, a lot of communication through the channels with\ncustomers, branch staff, etcetera, has led us to a stage where we are seeing the end of the journey.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nWe have to refine a few pockets and are confident that in the next three to four months, we\nwould have regularized the situation. Of course, there's absolutely no problem in accepting that\nit took slightly more time than what we had anticipated. This was, however, a temporary\ninconvenience for a better tomorrow. We, as a management team, are very clear on it. And hence,\nour entire teams in the head office and in the branches are channelized towards ensuring a quick\nregularization ASAP.\nAnd as I said, we've already carved out or we've scoped out the problem. We are talking of\n49,000 customers in the SMA bucket out of 2.9 million, with a field force of about 8,000, branch\nstaff of about -- branch managers and above about 2,000, I'm sure we'll be able to kind of\nregularize ASAP. Once we are done, we will take up the second set of branches, which is the\nnon-Parivartan today, albeit it will be why we are wiser by experience in the first phase.\nRest assured, we will handle this very, very carefully. We have a lot of learnings from this\nproject, which we will implement, but we will only do it once we are completely regularized on\nthis -- the current set of 730 branches, which, as I told you, will need another at best three to four\nmonths. Going back to -- and if there are any more questions on Parivartan, we'll be happy to\nanswer in the Q&As.\nAnother update on branch opening. During the course of the year as articulated, multiple times\nand our focus is going the weekly repayment way. We opened 375 branches during the year,\nwhich have weekly repayment for the customers. In Q3, these branches have contributed 16%\nto disbursements, which we are confident as per our estimates. Next year, probably the same\nperiod, we will have upwards of 40%, 45% of contribution from these branches, if not more.\nOver the past seven quarters, there are a lot of things we've got right, a few things we missed,\nbut to summarize the process of learning continues. All our initiatives and steps converge on the\nfundamental objective of ensuring that the company is future ready. At this stage, we can say\nwith reasonable surety that the company is on course to becoming a process-driven and stable\nenterprise with professionals manning their respective domains. We are taking all the steps to\nensure the company becomes strong, to capitalize the opportunity that exists in the environment.\nNow to go into the highlights of the quarter. New customer acquisition, and I would urge you to\nkindly just follow this narrative because this is what we've been speaking for the last five, seven\nquarters. Our focus on customer acquisition is absolutely supreme. New customer acquisition is\nthe fuel for any organization. You might have as much vintage, but it's very important that you\nhave to keep on churning the customer base, attracting customers who are not good and getting\nin customers who are quality.\nIf you look at our new customer acquisition, our new customer addition during the year was 3.4\nlakhs, Y-o-Y growth of 56%. Quarter -- there was about 10,000 less than the previous quarter.\nWe acquired friends with -- these nine months we have acquired 9.5 lakh customers in the first\nnine months of the year, which is very close to 1 million customers. While this is 112% growth\nover nine months of the previous year, as a company, we are currently at 2.96 million customers,\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nwhich is just a shade below 3 million, which is a growth in customer base of 32% Y-o-Y and a\n10% growth over the previous quarter.\nCustomer acquisition story for us is the primary story that we are driving on the grounds, and\nwe are seeing the initial results that we see. On the AUM front, at the end of the quarter, we\nwere at INR10,404 crores, which is a 52% growth Y-o-Y and 6% growth quarter-on-quarter.\nThe geographical concentration risk, and I've been raising this point and I've been highlighting\nand touching upon this point over the last few calls, geographical concentration risk in MFI is\nthe biggest risk.\nOur top three states contribute 42% to our portfolio. The top 5 are 61%. Our aim, as elaborated\nin our Vision '28, the maximum contribution of any state should not be more than 11% to 13%.\nCurrently, we have two states in that range. We are at -- the top two states, which is Madhya\nPradesh and Orissa are 14%. The 14% is down from 16.5% when we had taken over. So we will\naim to get this in the range that I have just spoken, which will be a combination of the increase\nin the overall denomination or the denominator in the other states, plus selectively closing down\na few pockets in these specific states, which are not profitable for us.\nOn the disbursement side, disbursement for the quarter was INR2,543 crores with a Y-o-Y\ngrowth of 8% and a quarter on growth of 1%. I have given you the reasons. We were very well\non course to deliver INR2,800 crores to INR3,000 crores of disbursement. However, the October\nmonth when we were kind of just trying to manage the Parivartan in terms of putting the building\nblocks in place to ensure that there is relatively lesser disruption, so that took a hit. So that one\nmonth kind of led to where we are. But then we -- once again, we are not -- this quarter, we are\nback. In fact, November itself, we got back November, December and then January onwards,\nwe'll see the traction coming up.\nThe disbursement was short by around INR450 crores that I've already said. On the asset quality\nfront, again, going back to the presentation, if you look at our GNPAs, the GNPAs have\nincreased from 1.4% of last quarter to 1.61% in this quarter. While this is still below 2% of our\nguided number, however, we are fully cognizant of the fact that for us to kind of progress, we\nwill have to ensure that we keep the credit quality well under check.\nAs I had said the last time around, about 61% is contributed by the Parivartan branches. We'll\nprobably see a pain in one more quarter, if at all, there is while we'll try to manage. But -- if at\nall, we have to, we will kind of take that on our chin and move on. But the overall story, which\nis the regularization story on the field, the customer acclimatization to the new environment and\nmost importantly, our employees kind of adopting this model for the obvious gains has kind of\ngone up tremendously and hence, our confidence that this will be managed. Just a question of\nthree or four months.\nOn the financial side, once again, the net NPA was 0.48%, an increase of 6 bps over the previous\nquarter. The gross slippages during the nine months of current financial year has been INR113\ncrores, which is 1.1% of AUM. Gross slippage -- I'll repeat again, gross slippage during the nine\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nmonths of current financial year was INR113 crores, which is 1.1% of the AUM. Our\nprovisioning coverage ratio continues to be 70.45%, so there is no change in that position.\nCRAR continues to be a healthy 35%, indicating that the balance sheet is pretty healthy. On the\ncollection efficiency side, the net collection efficiency was 97.2%. The gross collection\nefficiency was almost 100%. Coming back to the liability side. We mobilized INR2,279 crores\nin quarter three, which is a growth of 8% Y-o-Y. All of you are aware about the new guidelines\non the qualifying asset and how the cash is a part of the denominator, which is used to calculate\nthe total assets.\nSo outside of the mobilization, we had INR900-plus crores of sanctions in hand, which we did\nnot draw for the reasons that I just mentioned. Currently, our weighted on the cost side --\ncurrently, our weighted average cost of borrowings is 12.3%. We are working towards reducing\nit to sub 12%. Because of our introduction into weekly models and the fact that we've introduced\nshorter tenure loans 12 and 18 months, we have seen the average maturity of assets -- the period\nfor average maturity of assets going slightly down.\nSo we have a positive ALM mismatch. The average maturity of liabilities is 9.6 months and\naverage maturity of assets is 12.1 months. We ended the quarter with a very strong cash and\nbank balance, which was INR1,669 crores. On the financial performance side, the income\nreported was INR657 crores with a growth of 75% Y-o-Y. Net income is up 60% to INR407\ncrores. The yield is 24.1%. And in the questions, we'll answer, there's a quarter-on-quarter drop\non the yield and the NIM we'll do the explanation in the questions.\nThe PPOP for the quarter was INR240 crores. This is a decline of 7% over Q2, and this is very\nimportant. I'm just repeating. The PPOP was INR240 crores, which is a decline of 7% over the\nprevious quarter, but this was because of a higher income of INR42 crores from direct\nassignment in the previous quarter, which, by design, we've kind of -- this quarter, we did direct\nassignment for which we booked income of INR20 crores only.\nSo against INR42 crores of income from direct assignment in quarter two, our income from\ndirect assignment in quarter three was INR20 crores. So this drop has led to the compression of\nthe PPOP and the NIMs and the ROAs that we just spoke about. Profit after tax was INR127\ncrores, which is a growth of 79% and a quarter-on-quarter 2% growth. Let me also reiterate the\ninitiatives. So this is the financial part, and we'll take all the questions that you would have. Let\nme just quickly complete the -- conclude my commentary.\nWe continue to progress on the five key levers of the -- running the organization. First is people,\npractices and communication; second is bringing the cultural changes in the company; number\nthree is process improvement; number four, as a company, we are now more data-driven; number\nfive, apart from the distribution initiatives, which is the Parivartan that I spoke about, we\ncontinue to pursue it.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nSpecific to distribution, we've taken the following steps, which are very important. And this is\njust a repetition of what we've been articulating all along. We will continue to progress on the\ncustomer acquisition-led growth. Moving to a weekly repayment from the current monthly is the\nend game for all of whatever we are doing. Number three, the geographical concentration\nmitigation approach is what we are pursuing. I've got into the details in the earlier part of my\ncommentary.\nGiven the relative growth opportunity that other states offer, if you remember, we had come out\nwith our -- when we came out with the Vision '25, we had identified seven focus states.\nCurrently, we are putting on the back burner or we are dropping Haryana from the list as we'll\ncontinue to focus on the other six states, which are namely Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West\nBengal, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. Haryana was in the list of top 7. So we are just dropping\nHaryana. We have a very small book of about INR40 crores there.\nSo we will kind of just go slow on Haryana, and we will focus on the other six states for various\nreasons. Our belief and philosophy -- our core belief and philosophy remains acquire more\ncustomers, lend shorter tenures, muted ticket sizes and monitoring indebtedness at customer\nlevel and weekly repayments, which we've already highlighted.\nI thank all the stakeholders of Spandana, the Board, our lenders and our colleagues in Spandana\nwho pooled in their energies during the year. A special note of thanks to all the branch staff, our\nloan officers, branch managers and the entire field staff who are slogging hard to deliver the\nresults. Thank you very much to all of you on the call. You've been a constant source of\nencouragement by giving us positive advice, feedback and, of course, support during the year.\nWe look forward to receiving similar encouragement in the future. We have the entire\nmanagement team with us, and we are ready to take the questions now. Thank you very much.\nModerator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, Zico, you can start the questions. People can keep joining. There are already some four or\nfive.\nModerator: Yes sir. Our first question is from the line of Abhijit Tibrewal from Motilal Oswal. Please go\nahead, sir.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Good evening, everyone. Sir, thank you so much...\nModerator: May I request you to use your handset, please?\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Yes. Is it better now?\nModerator: Yes, sir, please go ahead.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: So what I was saying is sir, thank you so much for an elaborate opening remarks. Just two\nquestions that I had. I mean, during the opening remarks you did touch upon the fact that yield\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nhave declined Q-o-Q. So if you can just explain that, like some of your peers, have you also cut\nlending rates during the quarter, which has led to this declining yields?\nAshish Damani: Hi, Abhijit. This is Ashish. No, we have not had -- we have not done any changes to our interest\nrate. So we continue to operate at 25% plus 1% the processing fee. The decline primarily was\nled by the continuing leverage improvement over the last 1 year. Plus there has been -- obviously,\nthere have been some flows that Shalabh talked about, which kind of contributed to the reversal\nof income on the GNPA side.\nThat's -- those are the reasons for the decline in NIM. However, what we expect is on a BAU\nbasis, a NIM of over 13.5%, which we should achieve in -- I mean we are not very far off from\nthat number. So we should be able to achieve it in the coming quarters.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. So Ashish, sir, I mean, just help me understand, essentially, it was interest income\nreversals, which you are suggesting led to a decline. So if you can quantify what was the interest\nincome reversals in this quarter?\nAshish Damani: So we had a total gross flow in the GNPA of about INR56 crores. And the interest reversal\nnumber was about INR6 crores on this particular aspect.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: And that is the only reason which led to declining NIM's?\nAshish Damani: Like I told you, there have been -- so multiple reasons. One is there has been some overdue book\nwhich is there in the 1 to 90 book. So as you collect that, you will be able to have a replacement\ninto the performing book. That is one. Second is this GNPA, which led to a INR6 crores drop,\nShalabh also touched upon.\nThere has been some DA's that we have done in the past. So when you do a DA there is a\npreponement of income. So I would have booked some income of that this quarter into the\nprevious quarter itself. So that always -- if that number was higher in the previous quarters, it\nwill have some impact on this quarter on an overall basis. Having said that, that's not necessarily\nimpact your NIM. The NIM is primarily impacted by the reversals, the overdue book and the\nleverage.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. And then maybe one last question that I had was on asset quality. I mean, we explained\nvery elaborately on how Project Parivartan kind of led to flows into the SMA buckets. But I just\nwanted you to elaborate on some other factors, if at all, I mean, like floods or seasoning of the\nbook or any geographic specific issues that resulted in -- I mean, asset quality deterioration\nduring the quarter ex of what you saw from Project Parivartan and maybe a related question\nhere, are you seeing anything unusual in Haryana, which kind of led you to drop it from your\nlist of focus states?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Abhijit, I'll take that one. The answer to your first question is that Parivartan Project has\nled to the disruption that we are speaking about on the vectors of be it a yield or be it a NIM or\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nbe it the ROAs, the -- and which is why I kind of took that extra 10 minutes to explain into the\ndetails and happy to connect separately also.\nThe point is that we -- there are two, three combinations. One is -- two, three reasons. One is the\ninterest, which is -- there are certain provisioning's you have to do within the 1 to 90 elevated\nprovisioning because of the SMA flows because of the installments that were missed for the\nreasons that I've already clarified.\nApart from that, the INR56 crores that Ashish spoke about, which went into the GNPA, these\nare the two reasons. Apart from that, there isn't a specific reason which could have led to a bump\nup. And hence, our confidence that we'll kind of regularize this in the next 3 to 4 months.\nOn the Haryana answer, right now, there -- state itself, there's a bit of a disruption there. We are\nin a position where we can stop it, our book is only INR49 crores -- INR40 crores, sorry, INR40\ncrores or INR41 crores. Punjab, we have -- so there are two places where there is some bit of --\nthis is what all of us have read in the newspapers.\nThere's some bit of a disruption in the environment. Punjab, we do not have any book. Our book\nis zero there. So it is time we have -- there is enough opportunity available in the 6 states. So\nhence, we have temporarily paused it, we will take a look at it maybe 3, 4 quarters down the\nline.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Okay, this is very useful. Thank you so much. I'll come back to the question.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you.\nModerator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rajiv Mehta from Yes Securities. Please go\nahead\nRajiv Mehta: Hi, congratulations on good numbers and thank you for giving me the opportunity. So I think\nfor clarification, can you separately give par and NPL for Parivartan and non-Parivartan\nportfolios? And then can you also comment on the non-Parivartan portfolio asset quality\ntrends? Is it stable?\nAshish Damani: Yes, sure. So there is no difference in terms of asset quality on the SMA bucket, obviously,\nParivartan is a bigger contributor. And most of the flows, if you see, 48% of the flows are still\nsitting in 1 to 30 bucket in the SMA bucket. So we're very confident that this should regularize.\nIn terms of numbers, Parivartan portfolio in SMA bucket is about INR87 crores out of the total\n-- sorry, GNPA bucket, it is INR87 crores out of total INR155 crores. And in the SMA bucket,\nit is INR147 crores out of the total INR249 crores.\nRajiv Mehta: Okay. Thanks for this. And Ashish, Shalabh also mentioned about maintaining credit cost for\nthe year at 2% -- or sub 2%. But if you look at the first 9 months credit cost, it's slightly higher,\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nmore than 2%. And then we also spoke about that the regulation of the existing BAU business\nwill take 3, 4 months.\nAnd maybe we may see in the interim further source happening in Parivartan branches in Q4\nthen how come the credit cost in the fourth quarter will be very low to give us a 2% average for\nthe year?\nAshish Damani: So what Shalabh intended or what Shalabh meant was if you look at the BAU business, we are\nat 1.4% and I think that definitely will be below 2% is the point that Shalabh was trying to make.\nOf course, we had some legacy pieces DA and you know the ARC for which we have provided,\nthose have been considered separately. The flows from the current business or the business that\nwe have been originating have been at 1.4%, and we are confident that it will continue to be\nbelow 2%.\nRajiv Mehta: Just one last clarification. This DA income which was lower, right to INR20 crores versus INR42\ncrores in the previous quarter. This is a part of the net gain on fair value changes, so even in this\nquarter, the overall number is still higher at INR56 crores, so if INR20 crores is delay income,\nwhat is the rest of that piece?\nAshish Damani: So we sit on some amount of free cash, because there is a difference or there is always cash in\nthe system or on the balance sheet. This is all parked in liquid funds -, mutual funds or in fixed\ndeposits with banks. So you do get some income, which is also recorded in the same line.\nRajiv Mehta: Okay. So we had higher gains on those investments?\nAshish Damani: Yes. We did have a higher cash balance compared to the last quarter and that is the reason it is\nhigher.\nRajiv Mehta: Got it. Thank you so much and best of luck.\nAshish Damani: Thank you.\nModerator: Thank you. Our Next question is from the line of Shweta Daptardar from Elara Capital. Please\ngo ahead.\nShweta Daptardar: Thank you, sir, for the opportunity. A couple of questions from my end. You did mention that\nthere is no revision in interest rates per se. But then is there any soft communication from the\nregulator given the fact that many of the micro financials are sounding recalibration of interest\nrates, the biggest player already bringing down by 50 bps. So what is the thought process or any\nsort of communication from the regulator?\nShalabh Saxena: No, no, see. The way we operate, Shweta, is we will do what is right. We are already in the\nprocess of reducing the interest rates for customers with cycle 6 and above. Likewise, we will\nkeep taking those initiatives to ensure that we pass on the benefits to the customers at large.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nIs there a formal communication from the regulator? The answer is no. Are we doing something\non our own? The answer is yes. Are we taking steps to ensure that the customers who've been\nwith us for many, many years are rewarded through some interest rates, which are beneficial to\nthem? The answer is yes.\nSo we will continue to take those steps without any proactive or nudge from anyone. And\nobviously, the regulator has already -- while there are no direct expectations, but as a prudent\ninvestor, we are ourselves walking that path and we'll continue to take that path. And you will\nsee this quarter, we would have already taken those steps. So the next time when we come to\nyou, we would have already executed those.\nShweta Daptardar: Understood. Sir, the second question is while we are graduating entirely to weekly model --\nshifting to the weekly model. So what are the occupation -- what is the occupational profile or\nthe frequency of income of this set of borrowers that we are targeting? And is there any -- so\nyou had explained this in the previous calls as well, but is there any sort of inertia in terms of\ntheir wages, frequency and therefore, our collection?\nShalabh Saxena: No, Shweta. So look, the profile of the customer, which is a demographic profile does not\ndrastically change between a monthly to a weekly. Monthly to a weekly is more a cash flow\nadjustment and calibration issue so that it becomes slightly easy for the customer to pay off every\nweek rather than wait for a month, accumulate her so-called savings from her earnings and then\ncome and give us that amount.\nSo it is more an inherent character of the distribution model that you run less to do with the\nalteration in the customer profile. Our customer profile irrespective of the repayment cycle is\nthis customer with typically a daily wage earner, with a small grocery shop, or a tailoring shop,\nor a garage, or cattle farming, or milk business, and so on and so forth.\nIt is their convenience and our belief in the model, which is leading us to get into the weekly\nmodel. A weekly liability of INR30,000 loan is anywhere about INR600 to INR650 which goes\nup to INR2,400 to INR2,500 in a monthly. Now technically, everybody -- there's nothing wrong\nin good times, Shweta. Good times, monthly will behave the same as a weekly and vice versa.\nIt is your conviction in the model, which will drive your choice of the model, be it a weekly or\nmonthly and which is what we are working to.\nOur belief in the model -- also what happens and that is what is our belief, the joint liability\ngroup works better in a weekly model because of the inherent size of the liability, which is 1/4\nof the monthly. So if you believe -- if you have belief in the model, if you believe that this is a\nmodel to be pursued, then in our wisdom, and there are no right answers or there are no wrong\nanswers.\nIn our wisdom, weekly is what we choose and this is where we will work, no major change in\neither the profile of the customer, whatever. It just adds a lot of discipline into the center\nmeetings. It adds a lot of discipline to our people. It adds a lot of discipline to the customers as\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nwell. And most importantly, the cash flows are managed is our belief, and that is what we're\nprogressing on.\nShweta Daptardar: Fair point sir, and one last question. So what are the number of unique borrowers to Spandana?\nAnd also any strategy to sort of increase this count? And then one, you made a fleeting mention\non fixed cycle loans. So at what ticket size we max out in terms of cycles? And is there any\nchange in increase in ticket size in the first cycle or sort of disruption or changes there on the\nticket size across cycles and where we max out? Thank you.\nShalabh Saxena: So, Shweta, two answers -- three answers to your question. The first is, ticket size is a measure\nto look at institutions and the way we lend. However, what we focus more on is the indebtedness\nlevel at a customer level. That's very, very critical, Shweta. Because what happens is, I can give\nyou three loans of INR30,000 in a year. My ticket size is still much, much lower, whereas some\ncompany would be giving a ticket size of INR40,000 with only one loan in a year. So what is\nthe ticket size is might not be the best from our point of view.\nOur indebtedness level currently are around INR34,000 odd, which is about 6% to 7% lower\nthan the industry. That's number one. Number two, if you see the way we've been progressing\non the ticket size, to your specific question, our maximum cycle loan is INR80,000 which, by\nany stretch of imagination, if you go around...\nYes. So my apologies for this, and I believe Shweta and everybody is still there. So our\nmaximum ticket size is INR80,000. We have no immediate proposal to increase the ticket size.\nWe believe we are 5% to 7% lower than the average indebtedness at a customer level in the\nindustry. We believe we will continue to progress on this. This is in line with our philosophy of\nmuted ticket sizes and lending shorter tenure. So just to give you some colour on the numbers,\nour monthly branches, Zico, can you confirm if people are online, right? I'm just -- sorry, I'm\njust...\nModerator: Yes, sir, you are audible.\nShweta Daptardar: Yes, sir we can hear you.\nShalabh Saxena: So, Shweta, if -- when -- about 2 years back when we took over, 100% of the company was 24\nmonths, we introduced the 12 and 18 months, that 100% branches or the monthly branches,\nwhich were -- where the portfolio was 100%, 24 months, we now have -- that 100% is down to\n83% only. 17% are the portfolio is 12 and 18 months, which means there are customers who are\nchoosing to go for shorter tenures, for various reasons, we can get into the details.\nNow I will go to the -- if I give you the statistics of the weekly branches. It is exactly reverse. It\nis exactly reverse. The 12- and 18-month tenure is 88%, 24 month is only 12%. So what this\nsays is that while the tenures can be shortened, yes, the runoffs are fast customers, however, kind\nof qualify for a second loan, but that is only after a period rather than giving a big loan it is\nimportant that we kind of graduate them into understanding our culture, understanding our\nbusiness and then we kind of graduate them to a higher ticket size loan.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nBut at any given point in time, we will never be aggressive on the size of loans that we will give.\nWe will incrementally keep on giving them many loans, but definitely not 120 and 150 that kind\nof a number, which is there. So very, very happy with the way we are progressing.\nTo your question on, what is the portfolio cut on how many customers have a relationship only\nwith us? So the numbers, I will read out the statistics, which will probably answer your question.\nRight now, if I see my portfolio, my incremental portfolio of last quarter, 30% of the customers\nthat we have are -- have only a single relationship with us, 3-0, 30%.\nAnother 31% have a relationship with one more outside of us. So it is 1 plus 1. Spandana plus\none more is 31%. Another 25% is 1 plus 2. So if you add up all of this, we -- this is 86% and\nthen 14% are 4 and -- 3 and 4 -- because they take loans from us and then they go and take a\nloan from somewhere else.\nSo the focus continues to be going deeper into rural India, trying to ensure that there is a good\ncounselling done to the customer to ensure she borrows right. And most importantly, we lend\nright. So it is -- it works both ways, and that is what we are doing. Any follow-up on this, Shweta,\nhappy to answer.\nShweta Daptardar: Yes. That is very helpful. I'm still squeezing in one last question. Sir, the 9-month credit cost --\nso correct me if I'm wrong, our 9-month credit costs are closer to 3%. So, what gives us\nconfidence that by the end of this year itself, we shall be below 2%? Thank you. That was my\nlast question.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. Sure. So, Shweta, I think this -- Ashish elaborated the answer, but I will repeat, the credit\ncost is split into two. The first is the portfolio credit cost and the second is the cost that we have\ntaken for historical reasons, there were various reasons while it still had to do with portfolio, but\nthese are all dated portfolios, 2018, 2019 and stuff, so that, if you see and there is a slide that we\nhave given on slide 13 in the investor deck, the right table at the bottom.\nIf you see the split, the split is 1.4% is the portfolio quality loss rate and 1.5% is the other cost\nthat I said. That other cost is a 1.1x cost, which is done dusted and over. Portfolio cost credit\nloss is what is on a sustainable basis has to be monitored and has to be looked at, which we are\ncurrently at 1.4%, and hence, our confidence that we'll be under 2% in the future as well.\nShweta Daptardar: Understood sir. Thank you so much for elaborate answers and best of luck.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you.\nModerator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ashwani Agarwalla from Edelweiss Mutual\nFund. Please go ahead.\nAshwani Agarwalla: Good evening sir. A couple of questions. First of all, we are approaching the election season. So\nthe Q4 and Q1, do you anticipate some kind of problem or a problem in intentions of paying the\nloan. We see some kind of problem in the MFI sector as a whole because of the elections?\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nShalabh Saxena: Is that the question? Do you have any more questions? Or this is the only question?\nAshwini Agarwalla: No, I've got a couple of more questions. What is the loan growth which we can expect for the\nnext 2 years? From which segments would it come, would be more tickets driven or more\ncustomer driven? And as you said, six states will be driving the loan growth. I mean how we see\nour ratios, so cost ratios, credit cost ratios, and ROA's for the next few years.\nShalabh Saxena: Understood. So you have four questions. I'll just answer one by one. Let me start with the\nsequentially, election. So elections, we've seen many elections over the past many, many years,\nbarring stray one example that I can remember very clearly. We have had a very stable economic\nenvironment, more driven by all the stakeholders, which is be it the judiciary or be it the political\nmachinery or be it the executive or even the customer and employee for that matter.\nSo I think we have seen a substantial majority creep into the system of the microfinance. And\ngiven the fact that this is bottom of the pyramid, we've seen a great understanding from a\ncustomer point of view on understanding that there is nothing called a free lunch now.\nCustomers are also mature. So they are very well aware that this will -- there is nothing called a\nloan waiver or whatever. So in our considered opinion, election should not disrupt or will not\ndisrupt because this is not the first. We've already seen one election in 2019, which happened.\nThis is during our -- in the last few years that we're talking about. Apart from that, there are state\nelections in practically every year, you see some 4, 5 state elections. So there's enough maturity\nin the system.\nAt the same time, one can't really discount stray happening here and there, but broadly speaking,\nboth from design perspective and the way the market has matured over the years, we do not\nanticipate much problem more so because there's a lot of support from a customer side also.\nCustomer is very well aware that a default here leads to complete disruption in credit borrowings\nfrom anywhere, why microfinance. So that is why they are extra cautious as well. Yes, there you\ncan't rule out a disruption on account of a flood or on account of a cyclone or all of those things\ncan happen. But those are all temporary. A couple of months, it takes 3 months, it takes to kind\nof regularize. So this is the first answer to your question.\nThe second answer is what will be the loan growth. We will end this year anywhere between\nINR11,500 crores, INR12,000 crores of AUM. Next year, we are targeting as per our Vision 25,\nINR15,000 crores. So that's a 25% increase on the loan book. For all the steps that we've taken\nthis year in terms of investment into branches, people, weekly and the Parivartan because that is\na straight input into quality that we will deliver. All of that, we feel that we'll be able to deliver\nthe loan growth more so because there's sufficient traction in the economy and in the market as\nwell.\nThe industry is slated to grow anywhere between 22% to 23%. So we're targeting a 25%, which,\nin our estimate, is a reasonable number to target.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nWhat will be the vectors that will drive this growth? The first is, we are -- what we have said is\nthat we are projecting a ROA of upwards of 4.5%. Our credit loss ratios will be under 2%. It will\nbe south of 2%. Our ROEs should be anywhere between 17% to 19%. We are -- from a growth\nin which states perspective, the six states that I spoke about is where the maximum growth will\ntake place. That is what is going to add a lot of balance to the geographical concentration that I\nkeep on repeating time and again in every call.\nWe want to aim that a state should not -- a single stage should not contribute or should contribute\nin the range of 11% to 13% and no more. Currently, our top three states are 42%. We are wanting\nto get them to 35% to 36%, which will be a good outcome.\nOn the opex side, we are currently at 6.6%. Our steady-state guidance has been that we will be\nunder 6%. So anywhere between 5.5% to 6% is what we will operate at. On a cost to income, I\nthink in the mid-30% -- so 35% to 38%, 39% in a steady state is what we'll continue to deliver.\nAshwani Agarwalla: So when we are moving from monthly to weekly collection models, don't we expect our cost to\nincome to increase?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So look, this concern of cost going up comes predominantly from the fact or from the\nassumption that the customer in a monthly goes only once and in weekly has to go four times,\nwhich might be a misnomer because that is not how it exactly translates.\nWhen you have to acquire a new customer, you have to go into the same village, you have to go\ninto the same community to acquire a new customer. When you go to collect that missed\ninstalment, you again land up in the same hamlet or in the same pocket.\nSo any saving on conveyance is largely the issue might not be the best way to look at it. Our\npersonal experience past organization, we ran a INR30,000 crores book, which was a weekly.\nIn fact, there are many examples of companies, which are run in the weekly model at a AUM --\ndelivering cost to AUM of about 5.5%.\nSo there is -- from a cost point of view, there isn't a -- there aren't -- there isn't sufficient ground\nfor anyone to corroborate or there is not enough data to even answer the concern that monthly is\nless expensive and weekly is more expensive. If you look at the balance sheet, the data doesn't\nsay so.\nI will flip this and say that in times of disruption, be it your demonetization or bit it your COVID,\nin times of a crisis, the weekly model is the first to come out of that crisis because of the inherent\nsize of the liability, I pay INR600 bucks and I clean up my -- I square off -- or rather I clear off\nmy one instalment, which is INR2,000, which is 4x in a monthly.\nSo that is why the weekly instalments kind of are slightly better model to follow in when there\nis a disruption or when there is a natural calamity. So to summarize, no data to support that\nmonthly is less expensive than weekly. There's enough data to support that the companies which\nare running the weekly model are running at probably better cost to income or cost to AUM --\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nopex to AUM. And in terms of crisis, obviously, there is enough data in the market to suggest\nthat in times of crisis, the weekly model is the first to come out. So that's the reason we are\nconfident on the model.\nAshwani Agarwalla: One last question, if I can squeeze in. In 2019, we had the Citizenship Amendment Act, just\ntalked upon, and so there was lot of turmoil in the country with few states specific. So what was\nyour experience then in your earlier company in terms of disruption in business, asset quality or\nany other problem which you have faced?\nShalabh Saxena: At least, to the best of my memory, I can't think of anything significant that would have happened\neven in a branch level, forget a geography level.\nAshwani Agarwalla: So that happened from 2018 September, October onwards till 2019 Jan, Feb.\nShalabh Saxena: So I was there very much when this happened. And I say this with reasonable confidence that\nthere is nothing which caused disruption to the overall industry, forget specific company. See\nyou will see these minor noises here and there, but does it disturb the equilibrium of the customer\nrepayments? The answer is no.\nAshwani Agarwalla: Okay, sir. Thanks a lot.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you.\nModerator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sarvesh Gupta from Maximal Capital Private\nLimited. Please go ahead.\nSarvesh Gupta: Congratulations on a decent set of numbers. Am I audible?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, yes.\nSarvesh Gupta: With respect to this Project Parivartan, now I heard the numbers. So broadly, your NPAs and\nSMAs are similar in the non-Parivartan and Parivartan buckets. So now that you are saying that\nthree, four months of pain is less in the half of the portfolio, which is got in under Parivartan and\nafter that, we will tackle the part of the portfolio, which is currently not under the Project\nParivartan.\nSo does it also mean that this year where we are totalling to more than 3%, 3.5% of credit costs.\nSo next year also not on a BAU basis, but overall, on the reported number basis, you might be\nsimilar to this year in terms of your credit cost. So that's the question number one. And second,\non the Project Parivartan where you have mentioned 50,000 accounts, so what is the expected\nslippage from this portfolio, which is still to be accounted for in your estimate?\nShalabh Saxena: So Sarvesh, let me answer. Let me -- I'll start the answer and I'll hand over to Ashish. Even\nthough it is a repetition in the call, but I'm sure and happy to kind of repeat. The credit cost, let\nme first answer the -- Shweta also asked a similar thing. And in our commentary also, we had\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\ncovered. The 2.9% that you are referring to, Page number 13 in the investor deck, bottom table\nright-hand side.\nWe've specified the two cost lines, 1.4% and 1.5%. 1.4% is the credit quality loss and 1.5% is\nthe non-credit loss, which is pertaining to the historical portfolio. There are reasons why this is\nthere. This is a onetime thing, which has been done, and it is over.\nThere is still some tail left but that is not a part of this discussion, so we're keeping that out.\nRight now, what we are seeing is that if one has to look at the character of the portfolio and how\nis it going to pan out in the future, you have to look at the portfolio quality, which is the 1.4%\nthat we have referred to.\nWe are saying 2%, and it will be under 2%, which we are reasonably sure that is how it is going\nto play off. Now on the specific thing, I will ask Ashish to repeat the numbers because it is the\nParivartan and non-Parivartan is not linear. There is a disproportionate flow in the Parivartan\ncorresponding to the portfolio that we have in Parivartan, so I'll ask Ashish to repeat the numbers\nso that all of us are on the same page.\nAshish Damani: So if you look at the SMA buckets, the numbers that I gave was INR147 crores out of INR249.\nThis is 61% compared to 39% in non-Parivartan. And this 61% should be related with the overall\nportfolio is 53%, is there is definitely a higher slippage or a move, which the Parivartan branches\nare showing at this point in time.\nSimilarly, in GNPA, the contribution from the Parivartan branches is 56% compared to 44%,\nwhich is in non-Parivartan. So overall, what we are trying to explain is the Parivartan branches\nare posing a larger challenge when compared to the rest of the book. If you have to look at it as\na BAU, it is still at 1.4%. But within the 1.4%, the larger challenge is coming from the Parivartan\nbranches, which would normalize is our point.\nShalabh Saxena: Just to complete this, and this was your question, what happens next year and what happens to\nthe unresolved piece on -- which is the non-Parivartan branches. I said it in my commentary, we\nare wiser by experience. And obviously, we will ensure that we don't do a repeat. Otherwise, we\ndo not -- I mean, we understand very well now how the customer behaves, how our employee\nbehaves, and hence, it will be absolutely calibrated. And we will not start it unless we are fully\nsatisfied with the Parivartan one. That goes without saying, Sarvesh, so that we are very, very -\nclear..\nNumber two, next year, what happens to the loss rates on account of this, as I told you, it is more\nto do with the time when we go -- our loan officer reaches the customer or inability to reach on\nthe same time as decided by the customer and vice versa, which has led to the slippage, will it\ncontinue - forever? Obviously not. Will we start Parivartan too unless this is settled? Absolutely\nnot. What is the projection of loss rates for the next year on this? Under 2% is what we are\nsaying. And I think we are -- even the numbers that trend now, if you look at it, I think we are\nfairly confident that, that will happen.\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nSarvesh Gupta: See the reason I was asking, so even if you look at this 1.4%, right, most of it has come into this\nquarter only. And now we are left with probably five more quarters of this Parivartan Project to\nbe done before it ends completely. And most of it, this has flowed into quarter three only. So if\nyou actually analyze for this quarter's credit cost, it comes to be much higher than 2%. So that\nis why there is a concern for just this 1.4% itself because now only we have started to see the\nflows into this NPA bucket. And secondly, on the 1.5% also, if you can give some guidance as\nto what else is remaining now? Or are we mostly done? Or do we have something more which\nwill come out from the historical book?\nAshish Damani: Yes. So on the first part, see, the Parivartan branches are likely to settle not in four quarters.\nWe've said four to five months. So at best one or two quarters, we should see this kind of settling\ndown. It should not extend beyond that. The second part of the question in terms of the other\npiece, this was asked in the last con call as well. We do have about INR60 crores more that will\ncome in this other part. Of course, it will come over a period of next one, two or three quarters\nmaybe.\nSarvesh Gupta: Okay. Thank you. All the best.\nModerator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anand Mundra from Soar Wealth. Please go\nahead.\nAnand Mundra: I missed it in the opening remarks you mentioned about the gross slippage and net slippage. I\nwanted those numbers?\nAshish Damani: Sorry, GNPA and NPA? Or just the numbers Anandji?\nAnand Mundra: Gross slippage, sir, for this particular quarter?\nAshish Damani: INR56 crores was the gross slippage in the GNPA bucket.\nAnand Mundra: Okay. And sir, net slippage, there would be some assets, which would have turned standard from\nNPA or gross and net are similar?\nAshish Damani: INR4 crores was the upgrade from the GNPA to back into the current bucket.\nAnand Mundra: Okay, noted, and sir the other question was, what about the bad debt recovery this quarter, sir?\nAshish Damani: So one is the INR4 crores that we talked about. Apart from that, we do have recovery from write-\noffs to the tunes of...\nShalabh Saxena: This year, I'll give you the yearly number, which I have...\nAshish Damani: INR5 crores is the recovery from write-off. But we do have ARC in other buckets.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Anand, on the nine months number, we've recovered INR71 crores -- INR72 crores is\nthe number that we recovered. We originally started with a target of INR125 crores. This quarter,\n\nSpandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nI think we should tip over the 100 number, 120 might not happen. But next year, we are targeting\n150 number, next year, next year. But this year, we are at a reasonable position to cross the\nINR100 crores of recovery across all buckets, all the GNPA.\nAnand Mundra: Sir, next year, you are targeting INR150 crores?\nAshish Damani: So this has ARC, the SRs that we have on the balance sheet, the number includes that part as\nwell.\nAnand Mundra: Okay. Understood. Thanks a lot, sir.\nModerator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question of a question-and--answer session.\nAs there are no further questions, I would now like to hand the conference over to the\nmanagement for closing comments.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you very much, all of you, for your sustained interest in our company. Obviously, there\nare things that we are doing which might not be popular but are extremely important and in the\n-- from strengthening the company point of view and from ensuring that there is -- this company\nsustains and is a future-ready company.\nWe are taking all the steps to ensure that we kind of create a wholesome model, which is more\namenable to scalability and withstanding any shock that might come or any disruption that might\ncome in the future. So we are taking all those steps. Thank you for all the support. We will\ncontinue our journey of Spandana into Vision 25, which ends the next year and then into the\nVision 28 that we've articulated. Thank you very much for all your support. Goodbye.\nModerator: Thank you. On behalf of Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited, that concludes this conference.\nThank you for joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines.\n",

Thank you, and over to you, sir.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you very much, Zico. Thank you all for joining the call and investing time in\nunderstanding the journey of Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited. As we present our results\non a really auspicious day, our journey into the company now is 7 quarters. The new\nmanagement that is Spandana 2.0 has been steering the ship now for more than 7 quarters. The\njourney has been exciting with a lot of learnings. The entire management team is very excited\nabout shaping the company to make it future ready. Let me take you through the updates for the\nquarter.\nQuarter 3 was a quarter where we crossed a major milestone by reaching an AUM of INR10,404\ncrores. This is the first time as an enterprise we have crossed the INR10,000 crores mark. Also\nfrom a profitability point of view, our PAT for the 9 months period was or is INR372 crores\nwhich has surpassed the full year profits of Spandana Sphoorty of the past many years.\nSo the story from an AUM perspective, from a profitability perspective seems to be on track.\nThere are, however, learnings which I'll cover in the subsequent narrative. On 11th of December\n2023, which is just the last year or rather a few days prior to the results that we are presenting,\nwe held our first-ever in-person analyst, investor, lender and stakeholders meet at Mumbai.\nTitled Spandana 2.0 Invested in Bharat, the entire senior management of the company presented\ntheir articulation of where and how they propose to steer their respective functions to the larger\ndelivery of the organizational goals. The event was attended by more than 120 participants and\nwe thank all of them for coming over and spending their precious time with us.\nA first for Spandana, the event was watched live by our over 12,500 employees. With Vision\n2025 halfway through, we presented the progress we have made against the benchmarks we had\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nset for ourselves. In the meeting, we also articulated our Vision 28 and the theme was 28 by 28,\nthat is a portfolio of INR28,000 crores by FY 2028.\nNow let me go to the regular operational updates for the quarter. Let me start with the rating\nupdate. We have had a few rating changes over the past few weeks, ICRA rating for Spandana.\nSo there has been a change in outlook from A stable to A positive. In CRISIL, CRISIL rating\nfor Spandana, there's a change in outlook from A stable to A positive. So we've had a change in\noutlook in both ICRA and CRISIL.\nAll of you are aware that we have a subsidiary called Criss Financials. There, we've had a rating\nupgrade from ICRA from the BBB+ stable to A- positive. So overall, the rating update and the\nprogress we are making on ratings is very much on track, and we'll continue to do all the things\nthat are required to ensure that we create a robust organization for the future. Now let me give\nan update on branch opening and business update. During the quarter, we opened 72 branches.\nWe now have 1,574 branches, of which weekly branches are 375. This also includes 18 new\nbranches opened during the year for Loan Against Property and Nano Loans under our\nsubsidiary Criss Financials. Over time, we have highlighted our faith in pursuing the weekly\nJLG model of microfinance. For the quarter, we disbursed -- which is the last quarter, we\ndisbursed INR407 crores in the weekly branches, which is 16% of the total disbursement in the\nquarter.\nWe now have a portfolio of INR535 crores in the weekly branches, which are currently\ndelivering a net collection efficiency of 99.7%. We will continue to pursue our journey to move\nthe company into the weekly model, which now brings me to the Parivartan project, which we\nhad launched in the month of July 2023.\nLet me just spend a few minutes here because it's very, very important that we are able to\ncommunicate the change that we are wanting to bring in the organization. We are wanting to\ncommunicate to you the challenges in that change. While the easier option for us as a team was\nto continue BAU, however, the model then which we are now trying to change was, we believe,\nwhat we had -- there were challenges in scalability of the model and most importantly, in our\nwisdom, what is right for the company.\nWe continue to progress on taking all initiatives to ensure that we do what is right for the\norganization. We will see some blips here and there in the quarter, but the long-term story has\nto be intact and which is what we are doing -- what we are attempting to do. In the last update,\nwhen we had come out with our Q2 results, I had elaborated our attempt at rejigging the\ndistribution model to better align with the way we think it would deliver optimum results in the\nfuture and a first step to move the monthly branches to weekly repayment branches.\nAccordingly, we had launched Project Parivartan across 730 branches Pan-India, which covered\n1.6 million customers. I will repeat, 16 lakh customers or 1.6 million customers across 730\nbranches were in the scope of the Parivartan model. While we had detailed the project last time\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\naround and had given a heads up on the disruption it would cost to our immediate business, there\nare many of you who reached out to us and advised us to elaborate on the project.\nAnd most importantly, how much more time it would take to normalize. Also, there were a few\npeople who asked why was it done at all? I will try to answer that. I did answer the why was it\ndone at all. Very clearly, we want to make the organization and the distribution model scalable.\n10,400 is where we have reached. We will end the FY'25, which is next year in thereabouts of\nINR15,000 crores, which is what we've been speaking to all of you about, with an asset quality\nof sub of 2% or rather credit loss of under 2%; ROAs of 4.5% and above; and NIM's of 13.5%\nand above.\nKeeping all of this in mind, scalability of the model is very, very important. The robustness of\nthe model and the strength of the model independently is extremely critical. And hence, we've\ndecided to walk the talk. Like when we took over, we had written off a chunk of the portfolio,\nwhich was not good. We, as a management, are -- will not deter to bite the bullet when required.\nWe thought this was required. This is needed for the company.\nThis is absolutely essential that there is a long-term story in our institution. And hence, we are\ncontinuing with this. So hear our take once again. The earlier distribution model of the company\nwas designed as monthly repayment, number one. Number two, collection cycle was from first\nuntil tenth of the month. Number three, disbursement was 11th onwards until 30th, 31st of the\nmonth.\nWhile there was no restriction, but practically in the collection days, -there -were hardly any\ndisbursement and the disbursement was focused on the balance 20 days. We wanted to alter the\nabove model to make it more distributed across the month, convert the repayment to a weekly\ncycle, and most importantly, ensure that all the three things core to microfinance, that is new\nmember acquisition, disbursement and collection, happen on all days of the month and not on\nselective dates or days.\nThis is very, very important friends and hence I'm kind of belaboring this point. In microfinance,\nour stop and start model does not work in our limited experience. You have to do disbursement,\nyou have to do new member acquisition. You have to do the collection all in one go, in the same\ntime, in the same geography in the communities that you offer -- that you operate in. And hence,\nthe Parivartan was a necessity.\nSo accordingly, we picked 730 branches Pan-India, which had about INR5,500 crores. Portfolio\nis about 53% of the book, across 1.6 million customers where we launched Parivartan in across\nthe months of July and August last year. In this, the repayment was changed. So what we did\nwas we changed the repayment from dates to days, which means instead of the installment date\nof first, second, third, fourth, we said now your installment will be either on a Monday of the\nweek or a Tuesday under specific time.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nSo the dates were converted in to days. This was a precursor to the weekly model that is generally\nprevalent across. And even in our company, the 375 branches, they operate on a regular week,\nMonday to Friday, all the three things collection, disbursement and new member acquisition,\nhappen all -- every single day. In this -- so I'll repeat again, in this, the repayment was changed\nfrom dates to days.\nThe 10 days repayment was compressed to weekly, that is week 1, week 2 and so on. This was\na precursor to move into the weekly repayment model for new loans. This required a change in\nthe repayment dates, change in center meeting day and time and changes in the loan officer as\nwell means the schedule of the loan officers also had to undergo a change.\nBecause of the wide scale and the fact that this involved almost about 5,000 loan officers, which\nis 55% of the loan officers. There were many instances wherein scheduled repayment dates were\nmissed by customers or our loan officers could not reach on time. Thus, due data collection took\na hit, resulting in the branch staff going to customers again during the month to collect the\nmonthly installments.\nHence, a lot of time was invested in redoing the process by the branch staff, reaching out to the\ncustomers, going for collections again, thus leading to a wastage of productive time. In many\nbranches post the transition, our staff were engaged in doing the rounds of the customers through\nthe month, thus impacting our disbursement cadence, which, as you would have seen in the\nmonth of October, our disbursement was probably about INR400 -- INR450 crores short than\nwhat we would have wanted, which we kind of got back to normal in the month of November\nand December.\nBut this was the immediate impact on the specific months that I spoke about. Apart from this,\nthere were slippages in the portfolio also across the buckets for the reasons that I mentioned.\nJust to give you some numbers, about 49,000 borrowers who are a part of the SMA bucket,\nwhich -- they contribute about 61% of the AUM in that bucket. So the impact was trade, likewise,\nif I were to look at GNPA, we are talking of 38,000 borrowers where 56% of the GNPA was\nfrom the Parivartan branches.\nSo the point I'm trying to make is, if we were to scope the problem, the problem is on 2.9 million\ncustomer base that we have. We are talking of 49,000 borrowers or 38,000 in the GNPA bucket.\nNow that they have flown already, we will definitely go and collect. But the point is larger point\nis this is to answer many questions and concerns that were raised while we've been actively\nengaged with most of you is why do this at all.\nWe are doing it because we want to take the company to an immediate 15,000 and an eventual\n28,000 by FY'28. The model, which was, at that time, prevalent, which we are attempting to\nchange, obviously, was not a scalable model. And that's why we are working the way we are. So\nwe've come, however, a long way since then. Of course, a lot of labor for the branch stuff, a lot\nof hard times for us and most importantly, a lot of communication through the channels with\ncustomers, branch staff, etcetera, has led us to a stage where we are seeing the end of the journey.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nWe have to refine a few pockets and are confident that in the next three to four months, we\nwould have regularized the situation. Of course, there's absolutely no problem in accepting that\nit took slightly more time than what we had anticipated. This was, however, a temporary\ninconvenience for a better tomorrow. We, as a management team, are very clear on it. And hence,\nour entire teams in the head office and in the branches are channelized towards ensuring a quick\nregularization ASAP.\nAnd as I said, we've already carved out or we've scoped out the problem. We are talking of\n49,000 customers in the SMA bucket out of 2.9 million, with a field force of about 8,000, branch\nstaff of about -- branch managers and above about 2,000, I'm sure we'll be able to kind of\nregularize ASAP. Once we are done, we will take up the second set of branches, which is the\nnon-Parivartan today, albeit it will be why we are wiser by experience in the first phase.\nRest assured, we will handle this very, very carefully. We have a lot of learnings from this\nproject, which we will implement, but we will only do it once we are completely regularized on\nthis -- the current set of 730 branches, which, as I told you, will need another at best three to four\nmonths. Going back to -- and if there are any more questions on Parivartan, we'll be happy to\nanswer in the Q&As.\nAnother update on branch opening. During the course of the year as articulated, multiple times\nand our focus is going the weekly repayment way. We opened 375 branches during the year,\nwhich have weekly repayment for the customers. In Q3, these branches have contributed 16%\nto disbursements, which we are confident as per our estimates. Next year, probably the same\nperiod, we will have upwards of 40%, 45% of contribution from these branches, if not more.\nOver the past seven quarters, there are a lot of things we've got right, a few things we missed,\nbut to summarize the process of learning continues. All our initiatives and steps converge on the\nfundamental objective of ensuring that the company is future ready. At this stage, we can say\nwith reasonable surety that the company is on course to becoming a process-driven and stable\nenterprise with professionals manning their respective domains. We are taking all the steps to\nensure the company becomes strong, to capitalize the opportunity that exists in the environment.\nNow to go into the highlights of the quarter. New customer acquisition, and I would urge you to\nkindly just follow this narrative because this is what we've been speaking for the last five, seven\nquarters. Our focus on customer acquisition is absolutely supreme. New customer acquisition is\nthe fuel for any organization. You might have as much vintage, but it's very important that you\nhave to keep on churning the customer base, attracting customers who are not good and getting\nin customers who are quality.\nIf you look at our new customer acquisition, our new customer addition during the year was 3.4\nlakhs, Y-o-Y growth of 56%. Quarter -- there was about 10,000 less than the previous quarter.\nWe acquired friends with -- these nine months we have acquired 9.5 lakh customers in the first\nnine months of the year, which is very close to 1 million customers. While this is 112% growth\nover nine months of the previous year, as a company, we are currently at 2.96 million customers,\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nwhich is just a shade below 3 million, which is a growth in customer base of 32% Y-o-Y and a\n10% growth over the previous quarter.\nCustomer acquisition story for us is the primary story that we are driving on the grounds, and\nwe are seeing the initial results that we see. On the AUM front, at the end of the quarter, we\nwere at INR10,404 crores, which is a 52% growth Y-o-Y and 6% growth quarter-on-quarter.\nThe geographical concentration risk, and I've been raising this point and I've been highlighting\nand touching upon this point over the last few calls, geographical concentration risk in MFI is\nthe biggest risk.\nOur top three states contribute 42% to our portfolio. The top 5 are 61%. Our aim, as elaborated\nin our Vision '28, the maximum contribution of any state should not be more than 11% to 13%.\nCurrently, we have two states in that range. We are at -- the top two states, which is Madhya\nPradesh and Orissa are 14%. The 14% is down from 16.5% when we had taken over. So we will\naim to get this in the range that I have just spoken, which will be a combination of the increase\nin the overall denomination or the denominator in the other states, plus selectively closing down\na few pockets in these specific states, which are not profitable for us.\nOn the disbursement side, disbursement for the quarter was INR2,543 crores with a Y-o-Y\ngrowth of 8% and a quarter on growth of 1%. I have given you the reasons. We were very well\non course to deliver INR2,800 crores to INR3,000 crores of disbursement. However, the October\nmonth when we were kind of just trying to manage the Parivartan in terms of putting the building\nblocks in place to ensure that there is relatively lesser disruption, so that took a hit. So that one\nmonth kind of led to where we are. But then we -- once again, we are not -- this quarter, we are\nback. In fact, November itself, we got back November, December and then January onwards,\nwe'll see the traction coming up.\nThe disbursement was short by around INR450 crores that I've already said. On the asset quality\nfront, again, going back to the presentation, if you look at our GNPAs, the GNPAs have\nincreased from 1.4% of last quarter to 1.61% in this quarter. While this is still below 2% of our\nguided number, however, we are fully cognizant of the fact that for us to kind of progress, we\nwill have to ensure that we keep the credit quality well under check.\nAs I had said the last time around, about 61% is contributed by the Parivartan branches. We'll\nprobably see a pain in one more quarter, if at all, there is while we'll try to manage. But -- if at\nall, we have to, we will kind of take that on our chin and move on. But the overall story, which\nis the regularization story on the field, the customer acclimatization to the new environment and\nmost importantly, our employees kind of adopting this model for the obvious gains has kind of\ngone up tremendously and hence, our confidence that this will be managed. Just a question of\nthree or four months.\nOn the financial side, once again, the net NPA was 0.48%, an increase of 6 bps over the previous\nquarter. The gross slippages during the nine months of current financial year has been INR113\ncrores, which is 1.1% of AUM. Gross slippage -- I'll repeat again, gross slippage during the nine\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nmonths of current financial year was INR113 crores, which is 1.1% of the AUM. Our\nprovisioning coverage ratio continues to be 70.45%, so there is no change in that position.\nCRAR continues to be a healthy 35%, indicating that the balance sheet is pretty healthy. On the\ncollection efficiency side, the net collection efficiency was 97.2%. The gross collection\nefficiency was almost 100%. Coming back to the liability side. We mobilized INR2,279 crores\nin quarter three, which is a growth of 8% Y-o-Y. All of you are aware about the new guidelines\non the qualifying asset and how the cash is a part of the denominator, which is used to calculate\nthe total assets.\nSo outside of the mobilization, we had INR900-plus crores of sanctions in hand, which we did\nnot draw for the reasons that I just mentioned. Currently, our weighted on the cost side --\ncurrently, our weighted average cost of borrowings is 12.3%. We are working towards reducing\nit to sub 12%. Because of our introduction into weekly models and the fact that we've introduced\nshorter tenure loans 12 and 18 months, we have seen the average maturity of assets -- the period\nfor average maturity of assets going slightly down.\nSo we have a positive ALM mismatch. The average maturity of liabilities is 9.6 months and\naverage maturity of assets is 12.1 months. We ended the quarter with a very strong cash and\nbank balance, which was INR1,669 crores. On the financial performance side, the income\nreported was INR657 crores with a growth of 75% Y-o-Y. Net income is up 60% to INR407\ncrores. The yield is 24.1%. And in the questions, we'll answer, there's a quarter-on-quarter drop\non the yield and the NIM we'll do the explanation in the questions.\nThe PPOP for the quarter was INR240 crores. This is a decline of 7% over Q2, and this is very\nimportant. I'm just repeating. The PPOP was INR240 crores, which is a decline of 7% over the\nprevious quarter, but this was because of a higher income of INR42 crores from direct\nassignment in the previous quarter, which, by design, we've kind of -- this quarter, we did direct\nassignment for which we booked income of INR20 crores only.\nSo against INR42 crores of income from direct assignment in quarter two, our income from\ndirect assignment in quarter three was INR20 crores. So this drop has led to the compression of\nthe PPOP and the NIMs and the ROAs that we just spoke about. Profit after tax was INR127\ncrores, which is a growth of 79% and a quarter-on-quarter 2% growth. Let me also reiterate the\ninitiatives. So this is the financial part, and we'll take all the questions that you would have. Let\nme just quickly complete the -- conclude my commentary.\nWe continue to progress on the five key levers of the -- running the organization. First is people,\npractices and communication; second is bringing the cultural changes in the company; number\nthree is process improvement; number four, as a company, we are now more data-driven; number\nfive, apart from the distribution initiatives, which is the Parivartan that I spoke about, we\ncontinue to pursue it.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nSpecific to distribution, we've taken the following steps, which are very important. And this is\njust a repetition of what we've been articulating all along. We will continue to progress on the\ncustomer acquisition-led growth. Moving to a weekly repayment from the current monthly is the\nend game for all of whatever we are doing. Number three, the geographical concentration\nmitigation approach is what we are pursuing. I've got into the details in the earlier part of my\ncommentary.\nGiven the relative growth opportunity that other states offer, if you remember, we had come out\nwith our -- when we came out with the Vision '25, we had identified seven focus states.\nCurrently, we are putting on the back burner or we are dropping Haryana from the list as we'll\ncontinue to focus on the other six states, which are namely Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West\nBengal, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. Haryana was in the list of top 7. So we are just dropping\nHaryana. We have a very small book of about INR40 crores there.\nSo we will kind of just go slow on Haryana, and we will focus on the other six states for various\nreasons. Our belief and philosophy -- our core belief and philosophy remains acquire more\ncustomers, lend shorter tenures, muted ticket sizes and monitoring indebtedness at customer\nlevel and weekly repayments, which we've already highlighted.\nI thank all the stakeholders of Spandana, the Board, our lenders and our colleagues in Spandana\nwho pooled in their energies during the year. A special note of thanks to all the branch staff, our\nloan officers, branch managers and the entire field staff who are slogging hard to deliver the\nresults. Thank you very much to all of you on the call. You've been a constant source of\nencouragement by giving us positive advice, feedback and, of course, support during the year.\nWe look forward to receiving similar encouragement in the future. We have the entire\nmanagement team with us, and we are ready to take the questions now. Thank you very much.\nModerator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, Zico, you can start the questions. People can keep joining. There are already some four or\nfive.\nModerator: Yes sir. Our first question is from the line of Abhijit Tibrewal from Motilal Oswal. Please go\nahead, sir.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Good evening, everyone. Sir, thank you so much...\nModerator: May I request you to use your handset, please?\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Yes. Is it better now?\nModerator: Yes, sir, please go ahead.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: So what I was saying is sir, thank you so much for an elaborate opening remarks. Just two\nquestions that I had. I mean, during the opening remarks you did touch upon the fact that yield\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nhave declined Q-o-Q. So if you can just explain that, like some of your peers, have you also cut\nlending rates during the quarter, which has led to this declining yields?\nAshish Damani: Hi, Abhijit. This is Ashish. No, we have not had -- we have not done any changes to our interest\nrate. So we continue to operate at 25% plus 1% the processing fee. The decline primarily was\nled by the continuing leverage improvement over the last 1 year. Plus there has been -- obviously,\nthere have been some flows that Shalabh talked about, which kind of contributed to the reversal\nof income on the GNPA side.\nThat's -- those are the reasons for the decline in NIM. However, what we expect is on a BAU\nbasis, a NIM of over 13.5%, which we should achieve in -- I mean we are not very far off from\nthat number. So we should be able to achieve it in the coming quarters.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. So Ashish, sir, I mean, just help me understand, essentially, it was interest income\nreversals, which you are suggesting led to a decline. So if you can quantify what was the interest\nincome reversals in this quarter?\nAshish Damani: So we had a total gross flow in the GNPA of about INR56 crores. And the interest reversal\nnumber was about INR6 crores on this particular aspect.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: And that is the only reason which led to declining NIM's?\nAshish Damani: Like I told you, there have been -- so multiple reasons. One is there has been some overdue book\nwhich is there in the 1 to 90 book. So as you collect that, you will be able to have a replacement\ninto the performing book. That is one. Second is this GNPA, which led to a INR6 crores drop,\nShalabh also touched upon.\nThere has been some DA's that we have done in the past. So when you do a DA there is a\npreponement of income. So I would have booked some income of that this quarter into the\nprevious quarter itself. So that always -- if that number was higher in the previous quarters, it\nwill have some impact on this quarter on an overall basis. Having said that, that's not necessarily\nimpact your NIM. The NIM is primarily impacted by the reversals, the overdue book and the\nleverage.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Got it. And then maybe one last question that I had was on asset quality. I mean, we explained\nvery elaborately on how Project Parivartan kind of led to flows into the SMA buckets. But I just\nwanted you to elaborate on some other factors, if at all, I mean, like floods or seasoning of the\nbook or any geographic specific issues that resulted in -- I mean, asset quality deterioration\nduring the quarter ex of what you saw from Project Parivartan and maybe a related question\nhere, are you seeing anything unusual in Haryana, which kind of led you to drop it from your\nlist of focus states?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Abhijit, I'll take that one. The answer to your first question is that Parivartan Project has\nled to the disruption that we are speaking about on the vectors of be it a yield or be it a NIM or\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nbe it the ROAs, the -- and which is why I kind of took that extra 10 minutes to explain into the\ndetails and happy to connect separately also.\nThe point is that we -- there are two, three combinations. One is -- two, three reasons. One is the\ninterest, which is -- there are certain provisioning's you have to do within the 1 to 90 elevated\nprovisioning because of the SMA flows because of the installments that were missed for the\nreasons that I've already clarified.\nApart from that, the INR56 crores that Ashish spoke about, which went into the GNPA, these\nare the two reasons. Apart from that, there isn't a specific reason which could have led to a bump\nup. And hence, our confidence that we'll kind of regularize this in the next 3 to 4 months.\nOn the Haryana answer, right now, there -- state itself, there's a bit of a disruption there. We are\nin a position where we can stop it, our book is only INR49 crores -- INR40 crores, sorry, INR40\ncrores or INR41 crores. Punjab, we have -- so there are two places where there is some bit of --\nthis is what all of us have read in the newspapers.\nThere's some bit of a disruption in the environment. Punjab, we do not have any book. Our book\nis zero there. So it is time we have -- there is enough opportunity available in the 6 states. So\nhence, we have temporarily paused it, we will take a look at it maybe 3, 4 quarters down the\nline.\nAbhijit Tibrewal: Okay, this is very useful. Thank you so much. I'll come back to the question.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you.\nModerator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rajiv Mehta from Yes Securities. Please go\nahead\nRajiv Mehta: Hi, congratulations on good numbers and thank you for giving me the opportunity. So I think\nfor clarification, can you separately give par and NPL for Parivartan and non-Parivartan\nportfolios? And then can you also comment on the non-Parivartan portfolio asset quality\ntrends? Is it stable?\nAshish Damani: Yes, sure. So there is no difference in terms of asset quality on the SMA bucket, obviously,\nParivartan is a bigger contributor. And most of the flows, if you see, 48% of the flows are still\nsitting in 1 to 30 bucket in the SMA bucket. So we're very confident that this should regularize.\nIn terms of numbers, Parivartan portfolio in SMA bucket is about INR87 crores out of the total\n-- sorry, GNPA bucket, it is INR87 crores out of total INR155 crores. And in the SMA bucket,\nit is INR147 crores out of the total INR249 crores.\nRajiv Mehta: Okay. Thanks for this. And Ashish, Shalabh also mentioned about maintaining credit cost for\nthe year at 2% -- or sub 2%. But if you look at the first 9 months credit cost, it's slightly higher,\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nmore than 2%. And then we also spoke about that the regulation of the existing BAU business\nwill take 3, 4 months.\nAnd maybe we may see in the interim further source happening in Parivartan branches in Q4\nthen how come the credit cost in the fourth quarter will be very low to give us a 2% average for\nthe year?\nAshish Damani: So what Shalabh intended or what Shalabh meant was if you look at the BAU business, we are\nat 1.4% and I think that definitely will be below 2% is the point that Shalabh was trying to make.\nOf course, we had some legacy pieces DA and you know the ARC for which we have provided,\nthose have been considered separately. The flows from the current business or the business that\nwe have been originating have been at 1.4%, and we are confident that it will continue to be\nbelow 2%.\nRajiv Mehta: Just one last clarification. This DA income which was lower, right to INR20 crores versus INR42\ncrores in the previous quarter. This is a part of the net gain on fair value changes, so even in this\nquarter, the overall number is still higher at INR56 crores, so if INR20 crores is delay income,\nwhat is the rest of that piece?\nAshish Damani: So we sit on some amount of free cash, because there is a difference or there is always cash in\nthe system or on the balance sheet. This is all parked in liquid funds -, mutual funds or in fixed\ndeposits with banks. So you do get some income, which is also recorded in the same line.\nRajiv Mehta: Okay. So we had higher gains on those investments?\nAshish Damani: Yes. We did have a higher cash balance compared to the last quarter and that is the reason it is\nhigher.\nRajiv Mehta: Got it. Thank you so much and best of luck.\nAshish Damani: Thank you.\nModerator: Thank you. Our Next question is from the line of Shweta Daptardar from Elara Capital. Please\ngo ahead.\nShweta Daptardar: Thank you, sir, for the opportunity. A couple of questions from my end. You did mention that\nthere is no revision in interest rates per se. But then is there any soft communication from the\nregulator given the fact that many of the micro financials are sounding recalibration of interest\nrates, the biggest player already bringing down by 50 bps. So what is the thought process or any\nsort of communication from the regulator?\nShalabh Saxena: No, no, see. The way we operate, Shweta, is we will do what is right. We are already in the\nprocess of reducing the interest rates for customers with cycle 6 and above. Likewise, we will\nkeep taking those initiatives to ensure that we pass on the benefits to the customers at large.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nIs there a formal communication from the regulator? The answer is no. Are we doing something\non our own? The answer is yes. Are we taking steps to ensure that the customers who've been\nwith us for many, many years are rewarded through some interest rates, which are beneficial to\nthem? The answer is yes.\nSo we will continue to take those steps without any proactive or nudge from anyone. And\nobviously, the regulator has already -- while there are no direct expectations, but as a prudent\ninvestor, we are ourselves walking that path and we'll continue to take that path. And you will\nsee this quarter, we would have already taken those steps. So the next time when we come to\nyou, we would have already executed those.\nShweta Daptardar: Understood. Sir, the second question is while we are graduating entirely to weekly model --\nshifting to the weekly model. So what are the occupation -- what is the occupational profile or\nthe frequency of income of this set of borrowers that we are targeting? And is there any -- so\nyou had explained this in the previous calls as well, but is there any sort of inertia in terms of\ntheir wages, frequency and therefore, our collection?\nShalabh Saxena: No, Shweta. So look, the profile of the customer, which is a demographic profile does not\ndrastically change between a monthly to a weekly. Monthly to a weekly is more a cash flow\nadjustment and calibration issue so that it becomes slightly easy for the customer to pay off every\nweek rather than wait for a month, accumulate her so-called savings from her earnings and then\ncome and give us that amount.\nSo it is more an inherent character of the distribution model that you run less to do with the\nalteration in the customer profile. Our customer profile irrespective of the repayment cycle is\nthis customer with typically a daily wage earner, with a small grocery shop, or a tailoring shop,\nor a garage, or cattle farming, or milk business, and so on and so forth.\nIt is their convenience and our belief in the model, which is leading us to get into the weekly\nmodel. A weekly liability of INR30,000 loan is anywhere about INR600 to INR650 which goes\nup to INR2,400 to INR2,500 in a monthly. Now technically, everybody -- there's nothing wrong\nin good times, Shweta. Good times, monthly will behave the same as a weekly and vice versa.\nIt is your conviction in the model, which will drive your choice of the model, be it a weekly or\nmonthly and which is what we are working to.\nOur belief in the model -- also what happens and that is what is our belief, the joint liability\ngroup works better in a weekly model because of the inherent size of the liability, which is 1/4\nof the monthly. So if you believe -- if you have belief in the model, if you believe that this is a\nmodel to be pursued, then in our wisdom, and there are no right answers or there are no wrong\nanswers.\nIn our wisdom, weekly is what we choose and this is where we will work, no major change in\neither the profile of the customer, whatever. It just adds a lot of discipline into the center\nmeetings. It adds a lot of discipline to our people. It adds a lot of discipline to the customers as\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nwell. And most importantly, the cash flows are managed is our belief, and that is what we're\nprogressing on.\nShweta Daptardar: Fair point sir, and one last question. So what are the number of unique borrowers to Spandana?\nAnd also any strategy to sort of increase this count? And then one, you made a fleeting mention\non fixed cycle loans. So at what ticket size we max out in terms of cycles? And is there any\nchange in increase in ticket size in the first cycle or sort of disruption or changes there on the\nticket size across cycles and where we max out? Thank you.\nShalabh Saxena: So, Shweta, two answers -- three answers to your question. The first is, ticket size is a measure\nto look at institutions and the way we lend. However, what we focus more on is the indebtedness\nlevel at a customer level. That's very, very critical, Shweta. Because what happens is, I can give\nyou three loans of INR30,000 in a year. My ticket size is still much, much lower, whereas some\ncompany would be giving a ticket size of INR40,000 with only one loan in a year. So what is\nthe ticket size is might not be the best from our point of view.\nOur indebtedness level currently are around INR34,000 odd, which is about 6% to 7% lower\nthan the industry. That's number one. Number two, if you see the way we've been progressing\non the ticket size, to your specific question, our maximum cycle loan is INR80,000 which, by\nany stretch of imagination, if you go around...\nYes. So my apologies for this, and I believe Shweta and everybody is still there. So our\nmaximum ticket size is INR80,000. We have no immediate proposal to increase the ticket size.\nWe believe we are 5% to 7% lower than the average indebtedness at a customer level in the\nindustry. We believe we will continue to progress on this. This is in line with our philosophy of\nmuted ticket sizes and lending shorter tenure. So just to give you some colour on the numbers,\nour monthly branches, Zico, can you confirm if people are online, right? I'm just -- sorry, I'm\njust...\nModerator: Yes, sir, you are audible.\nShweta Daptardar: Yes, sir we can hear you.\nShalabh Saxena: So, Shweta, if -- when -- about 2 years back when we took over, 100% of the company was 24\nmonths, we introduced the 12 and 18 months, that 100% branches or the monthly branches,\nwhich were -- where the portfolio was 100%, 24 months, we now have -- that 100% is down to\n83% only. 17% are the portfolio is 12 and 18 months, which means there are customers who are\nchoosing to go for shorter tenures, for various reasons, we can get into the details.\nNow I will go to the -- if I give you the statistics of the weekly branches. It is exactly reverse. It\nis exactly reverse. The 12- and 18-month tenure is 88%, 24 month is only 12%. So what this\nsays is that while the tenures can be shortened, yes, the runoffs are fast customers, however, kind\nof qualify for a second loan, but that is only after a period rather than giving a big loan it is\nimportant that we kind of graduate them into understanding our culture, understanding our\nbusiness and then we kind of graduate them to a higher ticket size loan.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nBut at any given point in time, we will never be aggressive on the size of loans that we will give.\nWe will incrementally keep on giving them many loans, but definitely not 120 and 150 that kind\nof a number, which is there. So very, very happy with the way we are progressing.\nTo your question on, what is the portfolio cut on how many customers have a relationship only\nwith us? So the numbers, I will read out the statistics, which will probably answer your question.\nRight now, if I see my portfolio, my incremental portfolio of last quarter, 30% of the customers\nthat we have are -- have only a single relationship with us, 3-0, 30%.\nAnother 31% have a relationship with one more outside of us. So it is 1 plus 1. Spandana plus\none more is 31%. Another 25% is 1 plus 2. So if you add up all of this, we -- this is 86% and\nthen 14% are 4 and -- 3 and 4 -- because they take loans from us and then they go and take a\nloan from somewhere else.\nSo the focus continues to be going deeper into rural India, trying to ensure that there is a good\ncounselling done to the customer to ensure she borrows right. And most importantly, we lend\nright. So it is -- it works both ways, and that is what we are doing. Any follow-up on this, Shweta,\nhappy to answer.\nShweta Daptardar: Yes. That is very helpful. I'm still squeezing in one last question. Sir, the 9-month credit cost --\nso correct me if I'm wrong, our 9-month credit costs are closer to 3%. So, what gives us\nconfidence that by the end of this year itself, we shall be below 2%? Thank you. That was my\nlast question.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. Sure. So, Shweta, I think this -- Ashish elaborated the answer, but I will repeat, the credit\ncost is split into two. The first is the portfolio credit cost and the second is the cost that we have\ntaken for historical reasons, there were various reasons while it still had to do with portfolio, but\nthese are all dated portfolios, 2018, 2019 and stuff, so that, if you see and there is a slide that we\nhave given on slide 13 in the investor deck, the right table at the bottom.\nIf you see the split, the split is 1.4% is the portfolio quality loss rate and 1.5% is the other cost\nthat I said. That other cost is a 1.1x cost, which is done dusted and over. Portfolio cost credit\nloss is what is on a sustainable basis has to be monitored and has to be looked at, which we are\ncurrently at 1.4%, and hence, our confidence that we'll be under 2% in the future as well.\nShweta Daptardar: Understood sir. Thank you so much for elaborate answers and best of luck.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you.\nModerator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ashwani Agarwalla from Edelweiss Mutual\nFund. Please go ahead.\nAshwani Agarwalla: Good evening sir. A couple of questions. First of all, we are approaching the election season. So\nthe Q4 and Q1, do you anticipate some kind of problem or a problem in intentions of paying the\nloan. We see some kind of problem in the MFI sector as a whole because of the elections?\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nShalabh Saxena: Is that the question? Do you have any more questions? Or this is the only question?\nAshwini Agarwalla: No, I've got a couple of more questions. What is the loan growth which we can expect for the\nnext 2 years? From which segments would it come, would be more tickets driven or more\ncustomer driven? And as you said, six states will be driving the loan growth. I mean how we see\nour ratios, so cost ratios, credit cost ratios, and ROA's for the next few years.\nShalabh Saxena: Understood. So you have four questions. I'll just answer one by one. Let me start with the\nsequentially, election. So elections, we've seen many elections over the past many, many years,\nbarring stray one example that I can remember very clearly. We have had a very stable economic\nenvironment, more driven by all the stakeholders, which is be it the judiciary or be it the political\nmachinery or be it the executive or even the customer and employee for that matter.\nSo I think we have seen a substantial majority creep into the system of the microfinance. And\ngiven the fact that this is bottom of the pyramid, we've seen a great understanding from a\ncustomer point of view on understanding that there is nothing called a free lunch now.\nCustomers are also mature. So they are very well aware that this will -- there is nothing called a\nloan waiver or whatever. So in our considered opinion, election should not disrupt or will not\ndisrupt because this is not the first. We've already seen one election in 2019, which happened.\nThis is during our -- in the last few years that we're talking about. Apart from that, there are state\nelections in practically every year, you see some 4, 5 state elections. So there's enough maturity\nin the system.\nAt the same time, one can't really discount stray happening here and there, but broadly speaking,\nboth from design perspective and the way the market has matured over the years, we do not\nanticipate much problem more so because there's a lot of support from a customer side also.\nCustomer is very well aware that a default here leads to complete disruption in credit borrowings\nfrom anywhere, why microfinance. So that is why they are extra cautious as well. Yes, there you\ncan't rule out a disruption on account of a flood or on account of a cyclone or all of those things\ncan happen. But those are all temporary. A couple of months, it takes 3 months, it takes to kind\nof regularize. So this is the first answer to your question.\nThe second answer is what will be the loan growth. We will end this year anywhere between\nINR11,500 crores, INR12,000 crores of AUM. Next year, we are targeting as per our Vision 25,\nINR15,000 crores. So that's a 25% increase on the loan book. For all the steps that we've taken\nthis year in terms of investment into branches, people, weekly and the Parivartan because that is\na straight input into quality that we will deliver. All of that, we feel that we'll be able to deliver\nthe loan growth more so because there's sufficient traction in the economy and in the market as\nwell.\nThe industry is slated to grow anywhere between 22% to 23%. So we're targeting a 25%, which,\nin our estimate, is a reasonable number to target.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nWhat will be the vectors that will drive this growth? The first is, we are -- what we have said is\nthat we are projecting a ROA of upwards of 4.5%. Our credit loss ratios will be under 2%. It will\nbe south of 2%. Our ROEs should be anywhere between 17% to 19%. We are -- from a growth\nin which states perspective, the six states that I spoke about is where the maximum growth will\ntake place. That is what is going to add a lot of balance to the geographical concentration that I\nkeep on repeating time and again in every call.\nWe want to aim that a state should not -- a single stage should not contribute or should contribute\nin the range of 11% to 13% and no more. Currently, our top three states are 42%. We are wanting\nto get them to 35% to 36%, which will be a good outcome.\nOn the opex side, we are currently at 6.6%. Our steady-state guidance has been that we will be\nunder 6%. So anywhere between 5.5% to 6% is what we will operate at. On a cost to income, I\nthink in the mid-30% -- so 35% to 38%, 39% in a steady state is what we'll continue to deliver.\nAshwani Agarwalla: So when we are moving from monthly to weekly collection models, don't we expect our cost to\nincome to increase?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So look, this concern of cost going up comes predominantly from the fact or from the\nassumption that the customer in a monthly goes only once and in weekly has to go four times,\nwhich might be a misnomer because that is not how it exactly translates.\nWhen you have to acquire a new customer, you have to go into the same village, you have to go\ninto the same community to acquire a new customer. When you go to collect that missed\ninstalment, you again land up in the same hamlet or in the same pocket.\nSo any saving on conveyance is largely the issue might not be the best way to look at it. Our\npersonal experience past organization, we ran a INR30,000 crores book, which was a weekly.\nIn fact, there are many examples of companies, which are run in the weekly model at a AUM --\ndelivering cost to AUM of about 5.5%.\nSo there is -- from a cost point of view, there isn't a -- there aren't -- there isn't sufficient ground\nfor anyone to corroborate or there is not enough data to even answer the concern that monthly is\nless expensive and weekly is more expensive. If you look at the balance sheet, the data doesn't\nsay so.\nI will flip this and say that in times of disruption, be it your demonetization or bit it your COVID,\nin times of a crisis, the weekly model is the first to come out of that crisis because of the inherent\nsize of the liability, I pay INR600 bucks and I clean up my -- I square off -- or rather I clear off\nmy one instalment, which is INR2,000, which is 4x in a monthly.\nSo that is why the weekly instalments kind of are slightly better model to follow in when there\nis a disruption or when there is a natural calamity. So to summarize, no data to support that\nmonthly is less expensive than weekly. There's enough data to support that the companies which\nare running the weekly model are running at probably better cost to income or cost to AUM --\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nopex to AUM. And in terms of crisis, obviously, there is enough data in the market to suggest\nthat in times of crisis, the weekly model is the first to come out. So that's the reason we are\nconfident on the model.\nAshwani Agarwalla: One last question, if I can squeeze in. In 2019, we had the Citizenship Amendment Act, just\ntalked upon, and so there was lot of turmoil in the country with few states specific. So what was\nyour experience then in your earlier company in terms of disruption in business, asset quality or\nany other problem which you have faced?\nShalabh Saxena: At least, to the best of my memory, I can't think of anything significant that would have happened\neven in a branch level, forget a geography level.\nAshwani Agarwalla: So that happened from 2018 September, October onwards till 2019 Jan, Feb.\nShalabh Saxena: So I was there very much when this happened. And I say this with reasonable confidence that\nthere is nothing which caused disruption to the overall industry, forget specific company. See\nyou will see these minor noises here and there, but does it disturb the equilibrium of the customer\nrepayments? The answer is no.\nAshwani Agarwalla: Okay, sir. Thanks a lot.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you.\nModerator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sarvesh Gupta from Maximal Capital Private\nLimited. Please go ahead.\nSarvesh Gupta: Congratulations on a decent set of numbers. Am I audible?\nShalabh Saxena: Yes, yes.\nSarvesh Gupta: With respect to this Project Parivartan, now I heard the numbers. So broadly, your NPAs and\nSMAs are similar in the non-Parivartan and Parivartan buckets. So now that you are saying that\nthree, four months of pain is less in the half of the portfolio, which is got in under Parivartan and\nafter that, we will tackle the part of the portfolio, which is currently not under the Project\nParivartan.\nSo does it also mean that this year where we are totalling to more than 3%, 3.5% of credit costs.\nSo next year also not on a BAU basis, but overall, on the reported number basis, you might be\nsimilar to this year in terms of your credit cost. So that's the question number one. And second,\non the Project Parivartan where you have mentioned 50,000 accounts, so what is the expected\nslippage from this portfolio, which is still to be accounted for in your estimate?\nShalabh Saxena: So Sarvesh, let me answer. Let me -- I'll start the answer and I'll hand over to Ashish. Even\nthough it is a repetition in the call, but I'm sure and happy to kind of repeat. The credit cost, let\nme first answer the -- Shweta also asked a similar thing. And in our commentary also, we had\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\ncovered. The 2.9% that you are referring to, Page number 13 in the investor deck, bottom table\nright-hand side.\nWe've specified the two cost lines, 1.4% and 1.5%. 1.4% is the credit quality loss and 1.5% is\nthe non-credit loss, which is pertaining to the historical portfolio. There are reasons why this is\nthere. This is a onetime thing, which has been done, and it is over.\nThere is still some tail left but that is not a part of this discussion, so we're keeping that out.\nRight now, what we are seeing is that if one has to look at the character of the portfolio and how\nis it going to pan out in the future, you have to look at the portfolio quality, which is the 1.4%\nthat we have referred to.\nWe are saying 2%, and it will be under 2%, which we are reasonably sure that is how it is going\nto play off. Now on the specific thing, I will ask Ashish to repeat the numbers because it is the\nParivartan and non-Parivartan is not linear. There is a disproportionate flow in the Parivartan\ncorresponding to the portfolio that we have in Parivartan, so I'll ask Ashish to repeat the numbers\nso that all of us are on the same page.\nAshish Damani: So if you look at the SMA buckets, the numbers that I gave was INR147 crores out of INR249.\nThis is 61% compared to 39% in non-Parivartan. And this 61% should be related with the overall\nportfolio is 53%, is there is definitely a higher slippage or a move, which the Parivartan branches\nare showing at this point in time.\nSimilarly, in GNPA, the contribution from the Parivartan branches is 56% compared to 44%,\nwhich is in non-Parivartan. So overall, what we are trying to explain is the Parivartan branches\nare posing a larger challenge when compared to the rest of the book. If you have to look at it as\na BAU, it is still at 1.4%. But within the 1.4%, the larger challenge is coming from the Parivartan\nbranches, which would normalize is our point.\nShalabh Saxena: Just to complete this, and this was your question, what happens next year and what happens to\nthe unresolved piece on -- which is the non-Parivartan branches. I said it in my commentary, we\nare wiser by experience. And obviously, we will ensure that we don't do a repeat. Otherwise, we\ndo not -- I mean, we understand very well now how the customer behaves, how our employee\nbehaves, and hence, it will be absolutely calibrated. And we will not start it unless we are fully\nsatisfied with the Parivartan one. That goes without saying, Sarvesh, so that we are very, very -\nclear..\nNumber two, next year, what happens to the loss rates on account of this, as I told you, it is more\nto do with the time when we go -- our loan officer reaches the customer or inability to reach on\nthe same time as decided by the customer and vice versa, which has led to the slippage, will it\ncontinue - forever? Obviously not. Will we start Parivartan too unless this is settled? Absolutely\nnot. What is the projection of loss rates for the next year on this? Under 2% is what we are\nsaying. And I think we are -- even the numbers that trend now, if you look at it, I think we are\nfairly confident that, that will happen.\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nSarvesh Gupta: See the reason I was asking, so even if you look at this 1.4%, right, most of it has come into this\nquarter only. And now we are left with probably five more quarters of this Parivartan Project to\nbe done before it ends completely. And most of it, this has flowed into quarter three only. So if\nyou actually analyze for this quarter's credit cost, it comes to be much higher than 2%. So that\nis why there is a concern for just this 1.4% itself because now only we have started to see the\nflows into this NPA bucket. And secondly, on the 1.5% also, if you can give some guidance as\nto what else is remaining now? Or are we mostly done? Or do we have something more which\nwill come out from the historical book?\nAshish Damani: Yes. So on the first part, see, the Parivartan branches are likely to settle not in four quarters.\nWe've said four to five months. So at best one or two quarters, we should see this kind of settling\ndown. It should not extend beyond that. The second part of the question in terms of the other\npiece, this was asked in the last con call as well. We do have about INR60 crores more that will\ncome in this other part. Of course, it will come over a period of next one, two or three quarters\nmaybe.\nSarvesh Gupta: Okay. Thank you. All the best.\nModerator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anand Mundra from Soar Wealth. Please go\nahead.\nAnand Mundra: I missed it in the opening remarks you mentioned about the gross slippage and net slippage. I\nwanted those numbers?\nAshish Damani: Sorry, GNPA and NPA? Or just the numbers Anandji?\nAnand Mundra: Gross slippage, sir, for this particular quarter?\nAshish Damani: INR56 crores was the gross slippage in the GNPA bucket.\nAnand Mundra: Okay. And sir, net slippage, there would be some assets, which would have turned standard from\nNPA or gross and net are similar?\nAshish Damani: INR4 crores was the upgrade from the GNPA to back into the current bucket.\nAnand Mundra: Okay, noted, and sir the other question was, what about the bad debt recovery this quarter, sir?\nAshish Damani: So one is the INR4 crores that we talked about. Apart from that, we do have recovery from write-\noffs to the tunes of...\nShalabh Saxena: This year, I'll give you the yearly number, which I have...\nAshish Damani: INR5 crores is the recovery from write-off. But we do have ARC in other buckets.\nShalabh Saxena: Yes. So Anand, on the nine months number, we've recovered INR71 crores -- INR72 crores is\nthe number that we recovered. We originally started with a target of INR125 crores. This quarter,\n",
            "Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited\nJanuary 22, 2024\nI think we should tip over the 100 number, 120 might not happen. But next year, we are targeting\n150 number, next year, next year. But this year, we are at a reasonable position to cross the\nINR100 crores of recovery across all buckets, all the GNPA.\nAnand Mundra: Sir, next year, you are targeting INR150 crores?\nAshish Damani: So this has ARC, the SRs that we have on the balance sheet, the number includes that part as\nwell.\nAnand Mundra: Okay. Understood. Thanks a lot, sir.\nModerator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the last question of a question-and--answer session.\nAs there are no further questions, I would now like to hand the conference over to the\nmanagement for closing comments.\nShalabh Saxena: Thank you very much, all of you, for your sustained interest in our company. Obviously, there\nare things that we are doing which might not be popular but are extremely important and in the\n-- from strengthening the company point of view and from ensuring that there is -- this company\nsustains and is a future-ready company.\nWe are taking all the steps to ensure that we kind of create a wholesome model, which is more\namenable to scalability and withstanding any shock that might come or any disruption that might\ncome in the future. So we are taking all those steps. Thank you for all the support. We will\ncontinue our journey of Spandana into Vision 25, which ends the next year and then into the\nVision 28 that we've articulated. Thank you very much for all your support. Goodbye.\nModerator: Thank you. On behalf of Spandana Sphoorty Financial Limited, that concludes this conference.\nThank you for joining us, and you may now disconnect your lines.\n"
